	<h2>JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Tristan Albatross Diomedea dabbenena qualifies as globally Critically Endangered due to its extremely small breeding range, population declines and a projected rapid population decline over the next three generations. The species occurs in South African waters and, by virtue of its global status, the species is listed as regionally Critically Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is listed as globally Critically Endangered. Birds occurring within South African waters have been killed by longline fishing vessels (Petersen et al. 2009a). The global status of the species and the impact that South African fisheries are having on the global population warranted its inclusion in the 2015 assessment.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Tristan Albatross was separated from the Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans in 1998 based on genetic, morphological and other character differences (Robertson and Nunn 1998, Cuthbert et al. 2003a).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">100-110 cm. 6-7 kg. Sexes differ slightly in plumage colouration. Highly variable with plumage gradually whitening over a period of 20 years, more slowly than Wandering Albatross. Indistinguishable from the latter at sea (Ryan 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Tristan Albatrosses breed only at Inaccessible and Gough islands (part of the United Kingdom’s Overseas Territory of St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha) in the central southern Atlantic Ocean (Cooper 2000a). The Inaccessible Island colony has produced less than one chick per year since at least the 1980s (Ryan 2005a). Distribution at sea is little known due to confusion with Wandering Albatross although satellite-tracking data from 38 individuals indicated that during the breeding season the species is largely restricted to the southern Atlantic Ocean (Cuthbert et al. 2005). More recent tracking data shows adults moving eastwards into Australasian waters, and also into lower latitudes in the East Atlantic, as far as southern Angola (Reid et al. 2013). A small proportion of these are in South African waters at any one time. Regionally, the Tristan Albatross overlaps with the ranges of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The annual breeding population on Gough Island is estimated to be 1 747 pairs, equivalent to 7 100 individuals or 4 700 mature individuals (ACAP 2009a). The number of birds present in South African waters is unknown. The confidence in this population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population on Gough is decreasing at a rate of 2.85% per year, and mean chick production is decreasing annually by 1% (Wanless 2007, Wanless et al. 2009). As a result, a decrease of = 80% over the next three generations in the global population is expected (BirdLife International 2014a). The confidence in this population trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The breeding cycle of the Tristan Albatross lasts for 12 months and is biennial except if breeding fails early, when it will attempt to breed the following year (Cooper 2000a, ACAP 2009a). Mate fidelity is high (Cooper 2000a). A generation length of 28.7 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014a). The species is a surface-seizer feeding predominantly on cephalopods and fish (ACAP 2009a). </p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat is from interaction with longline fishing vessels leading to drownings (Tuck et al. 2003), mainly off South America (Cuthbert et al. 2004) with only a few individuals having been killed on longlines off South Africa (Petersen et al. 2009a). A secondary, but still significant, threat is from predation by introduced House Mice Mus musculus on Tristan Albatross chicks which accounts for up to 50% of nesting failures by the Tristan Albatross (Wanless, t al. 2007). Plastic remains are occasionally seen in stomach contents of chicks on Gough Island (RM Wanless pers. obs.)</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Conservation of Native Organisms and Natural Habitats (Tristan da Cunha) Ordinance of 2006 and the Gough and Inaccessible Islands World Heritage Site Management Plan of 2010 and its Appendix A2 of 2012 set out measures providing protection to the species (Cooper 2000a). Together Gough and Inaccessible Islands and their 12-nautical mile territorial waters form a World Heritage Site, and separately both are Ramsar Sites of International Importance since 2008. Both islands and their territorial waters are nature reserves in terms of the 2006 ordinance. Strong local action in South African longline fisheries is reducing incidental catch of albatrosses. This needs to be transferred internationally to all longline vessels operating within the foraging range of this species, especially off the Atlantic Coast of South America within the species’ range. South Africa, along with the United Kingdom, is listed as a Principal Range State for the species by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP 2009a).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Eradication of House Mice on Gough Island must be seen as the very highest priority. At sea-threats need to be reduced via implementation of bycatch mitigation measures. Improvement in the identification by bycatch assessors is required. The strengthening of mandatory seabird con&#173;servation measures at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission have provided a good basis for improved mitigation of seabird bycatch in both ocean basins. Additionally, both observer programmes should have increased coverage of longline efforts in waters south of 25°S, and observer data reporting requirements and accessibility should be improved.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the stately Wattled Crane Bugeranus carunculatus satisfies the population-size criterion for regionally Critically Endangered, with a &lt;250 mature individuals occurring in the region, the vast majority of this number occurring in the wetlands of KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was listed as regionally Critically Endangered in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">120-175 cm, 7.5-8.4 kg. A tall, stately crane of upland marshes. Sexes similar but male slightly larger. Head dark slaty grey above the eyes and crown, otherwise white, including the wattles, which are almost fully feathered and hang down from upper throat. Breast, primaries, secondaries, and tail coverts black. Secondaries long nearly reaching the ground. Upper breast and neck white extending up to the face. Back and wings ashy grey. Legs and toes black. Juveniles have tawny body plumage, lack the bare skin on the face, and have less prominent wattles (Allan 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Wattled Crane is restricted to Africa, with three sub-populations recognised (Beilfuss et al. 2007). The largest sub-population of c. 7 000 birds is located in the central southern African states of Zambia, Botswana, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Birds occurring within this core area undertake movements in response to environmental conditions (Allan 2005a). Two smaller populations of similar size occur in Ethiopia and South Africa (Beilfuss et al. 2007). South Africa’s population of Wattled Cranes was historically widespread and found in all four of the former provinces. However, the species’ range has reduced significantly, resulting in it being confined to the eastern grasslands of South Africa, with the core of the population located in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. The two most important protected sites are Umgeni Vlei (14-16 mature individuals) and Ntsikeni Vlei (8-10 mature individuals) followed by Mvoti Vlei, Karkloof, Kamberg and Highmoor. A few pairs of Wattled Cranes are found in the grasslands of northern Eastern Cape around Ugie and Maclear (6-10 mature individuals) and the Highveld grasslands of Mpumalanga and eastern Free State (10-20 mature individuals) (McCann 2003). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In South Africa, breeding pairs are largely sedentary, while non-breeding birds or ‘floaters’ tend to move up to 130 km away from the breeding sites (Johnson and Barnes 1991). There is no evidence of movement in and out of the region (McCann 2001) and the regional population is therefore considered a single sub-population of the African population. The species is regionally extinct in Swaziland (Monadjem et al. 2003). The last record of Wattled Crane in Lesotho was at Sehlabathebe National Park in the early 1980s (Osborne and Tigar 1990).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at c. 8 000 mature individuals (Beilfuss et al. 2007). In 1980, the regional population was estimated at c. 380 mature individuals (McCann et al. 2000). The results of the annual crane census in 1999 put the estimated population at 235 individuals (McCann 2001). Since 1999, the population has increased slightly with an estimated 245 mature individuals recorded (Endangered Wildlife Trust unpubl. data). Confidence in this regional population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has undergone a rapid decline over the past three generations in nine of the 14 range states (Beilfuss et al. 2007). Beilfuss et al. (2007) estimated that the regional population of Wattled Crane had declined by 36% over the past three decades with a dramatic restriction in range. Extrapolating this over three generations (39 years) would result in a decline in the regional population by 42%. Confidence in this estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Wattled Crane breeding pairs in KwaZulu-Natal occupy areas from 960-2 066 masl where rainfall averages 925 mm per year (range 675-1 650 mm) while birds in Mpumalanga breed on an ecologically distinct, plateau-like watershed about 50 x 20 km in extent, at an altitude of 1 850-2 300 masl (Morrison and Bothma 1998). High annual rainfall (1 270 mm) and poor surface drainage have resulted in numerous permanently wet marshy areas (Tarboton 1984) with breeding territories being located in permanently inundated sedge wetlands (Meine and Archibald 1996). In the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, active Wattled Crane breeding pairs used wetlands ranging in size from 10-300 ha (n = 32 wetlands). The average size of a breeding site was 106.5 ha (McCann et al. 2000). The generation length is 13 years (BirdLife International 2014b). </p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat and main cause of decline over the past three decades has been the loss and degradation of permanent, palustrine wetlands through intensified agriculture, afforestation, dam construction, alien plant infestation and draining of wetlands (McCann et al. 2000). Grassland areas surrounding breeding sites are vital for foraging and cover for chicks. Habitat loss in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga continues at an alarming rate due to agriculture, forestry and mining (Allan et al. 1997b). Inappropriate management of wetlands with regard to timing and frequency of burning is a threat to nesting Wattled Cranes (Bentos 2002). Wetlands are used as fire breaks on agricultural and forestry properties and burning often coincides with the peak period for Wattled Crane breeding, leading to loss of eggs and chicks. Wattled Cranes are particularly prone to collisions with overhead power-lines, especially those located between breeding, roosting, and foraging sites (Smallie 2012). The threat of illegal removal of eggs and or chicks from the wild is relevant and strict trade control measures need to be implemented (CITES 2004).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Crane conservation efforts in the region started in the 1980s due to significant population declines of the three crane species found in South Africa. Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, a government conservation body, protects and conserves important crane habitats through its network of nature reserves. Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife also undertakes annual aerial surveys of cranes within the province. The KwaZulu-Natal Crane Foundation, which was founded in 1989, works with land-owners raising awareness and encouraging sustainable management practices. The Endangered Wildlife Trust began crane research and conservation action in 1994. Efforts to date have included monitoring, power-line investigations and mitigation, crop damage research and mitigation, awareness creation and conservation of key areas through promotion of sustainable management and, more recently, inclusion of key areas into the Biodiversity Stewardship Programme. The Wildlands Conservation Trust, a KwaZulu-Natal based NGO, works closely with Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife and has been involved in purchasing important wetland and crane habitats within KwaZulu-Natal. The Johannesburg Zoo coordinates the Wattled Crane Recovery Programme, which is a captive-rearing programme. In 2000, a Wattled Crane PHVA was completed, which saw the formation and formalisation of the Wattled Crane Recovery Programme, and in 2010 there was a review of the PHVA to determine progress. Endangered Wildlife Trust’s African Crane Conservation Programme, with input from other stakeholders, is in the process of completing a Biodiversity Management Plan for all three species of cranes in South Africa.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In 2000, Eskom and the Endangered Wildlife Trust completed the marking of power-lines in close proximity to active Wattled Crane nest sites. However, it is recommended that this project is revisited to determine if any new sections of lines need to be marked or if previously marked sections need refitting of bird diverters. Supplementation of the wild population is recommended and this can be achieved through the Wattled Crane Recovery Programme. Securing key breeding and foraging sites, through Biodiversity Stewardship agreements or land acquisition, is strongly recommended to prevent loss of crucial habitat. All wetlands that Wattled Cranes use or have used in the past for nesting should be assessed, and recommendations put forward for rehabilitation.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Southern Banded Snake Eagle Circaetus fasciolatus has been estimated at 40-50 mature individuals qualifying it as regionally Critically Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the species’ global distribution falls within the region. In addition, the species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">55-60 cm, 1-1.2 kg. A buzzard-sized, inconspicuous raptor of forest edges. Sexes alike although female slightly larger. Crown, nape and upperparts of the adult dark grey-brown, as are throat and upper breast. Belly is white with distinct, narrow brown barring. Tail blackish grey with three diagnostic paler grey-brown bands. Tarsi are unfeathered and heavily scaled. Head is large with obvious pale yellow eyes, while the bill is black with a yellow cere. Juvenile has white streaks on the crown, with a brown nape, the face streaked black and white and the throat white leading to an off-white belly. Remainder of underparts are pale buffy grey, with indistinct brown barring on the flanks and thighs. Eyes and cere deeper yellow than in adult (Chittenden 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species has a wide, albeit extremely fragmented, distribution from southern Somalia to northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In southern Africa, there are three sub-populations; central Mozambique between the Zambezi River and Beira (Parker 1999), one in Zimbabwe, and one in the Maputo province of southern Mozambique and the coastal lowlands of Maputaland in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal (Chittenden 2005a). The iSimangaliso Wetland Park forms the core of its range in the region, with birds also occurring in Ndumo and Mkuze game reserves. The species is not confined to these IBAs, with 35% of birds recorded in SABAP2 being recorded outside of the IBA network in the area. Birds have been recorded further south at uMlalazi Nature Reserve as well as Dhlinza and Ngoye forest reserves. Breeding at these sites has yet to be confirmed.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 670-2 000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014c). The regional population was previously estimated at between 35-45 mature individuals, although mention was made of c. 20 pairs in the St Lucia region of northern KwaZulu-Natal (Ginn et al. 1989). No birds have been recorded from Swaziland. No reliable data, including the number of breeding pairs, exist. Expert opinion, provided by the reviewers, placed the regional population in the region of 40-50 mature individuals. The confidence in this regional population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Globally, the population is suspected to be in decline owing to ongoing habitat destruction (BirdLife International 2014c). There is no evidence of a decrease in numbers in the last 20 years and the establishment of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, and subsequent listing as a World Heritage site in 1999, has ensured that large portions of the habitat that the species depends upon in the region is protected. The regional population is assumed to be stable in the absence of any evidence indicating declines. Confidence in this trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Southern Banded Snake Eagles occur in coastal lowlands below 500 masl with a preference for Sand Forest thickets, lowland Coastal Dune Forest margins interspersed with clearings and coastal grasslands. It has been known to make use of exotic plantations. It is a resident species but immature birds appear to wander in search of breeding territories (Chittenden 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Loss of habitat due to silviculture, agriculture and tourist developments in the previous century led to a corresponding decrease in the range and size of the Southern Banded Snake Eagle population in the region (Chittenden 2005a). The establishment of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, as well as a number of private reserves in the Hluhluwe area, has partly ameliorated this situation. Fortunately the species has not been much persecuted by land-owners because it is an unobtrusive predator of small and medium-sized amphibians and reptiles (Brooke 1984), and it does not pose a threat to livestock- or game-farming operations. However, the portion of the sub-population in neighbouring Maputo Province, Mozambique is not as fortunate and is facing increasing pressure from accelerating habitat loss (Parker 1999). The threats affecting this species are understood and have, to a degree, largely ceased within the region.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no species-specific conservation actions currently in place for this species. From a habitat perspective, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, which forms the core of its range in the region, is protected as a World Heritage Site. Mkuze, Ndumo and uMlalazi reserves are protected under the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Management Amendment Act No 5 of 1999. The species is currently listed as Vulnerable under the National Environmental Management Act of 2004. </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Regular surveys to monitor the population should be conducted as should the monitoring of rates of forest clearance and degradation in buffer zones adjacent to core areas. Where possible the number of protected areas within its range should be increased. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Taita Falcon Falco fasciinucha is patchily distributed and generally rare throughout its sparse African range. Its occurrence in the region was only relatively recently discovered, and it has an extremely small regional population size of &lt;50 mature individuals satisfying the population criterion for regionally Critically Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population was estimated at 1 000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014d). This figure may be an overestimate, given that there are &lt;40 currently occupied and active nest sites known across its entire range (Hartley 2000, Jenkins 2008). There are at least seven known nest sites in South Africa. The species is listed as globally Near Threatened and this, together with the relatively small size of the global population, uncertainty surrounding global and regional population estimates, and the relatively high proportion of known nest sites located in the region, led to the species being included in the 2015 regional assessment.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No known issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">25-28 cm, 210-320 g. Sexes alike. A small, compact falcon. Black moustachial stripes contrast with white cheek and throat. Underparts rufous. Forehead, ear and nape patches are cinnamon; remainder of nape and mantle dark slate grey. Flight feathers black with narrow buff edges; undersides grey, barred blackish with cinnamon-rufous coverts. Undertail grey, barred blackish. Bill blackish with orange-yellow cere. Eyes dark brown with orange-yellow eye-ring. Legs and feet orange-yellow (Jenkins and Hartley 2005). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The distribution of Taita Falcon, throughout its range from southern Ethiopia to South Africa, is extremely fragmented (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001); even within areas where conditions would seem to be ideal it is rare. The species is highly sedentary, but there is some evidence of movements away from breeding areas in the non-breeding season (Hartley 2000). Within the region, the species is restricted to the Drakensberg Escarpment in Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces, with a reported AoO of 2 823 km2. Realistically the AoO occupied by the territories of just 20 known mature individuals is closer to 5 % of this figure; 141 km2. It is represented in the Blyde River Canyon (SA127) and Soutpansberg (SA003) IBAs.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at c. 1 000 mature individuals by BirdLife International (2014d). Confidence in this figure is low and the true number may be substantially lower. The first breeding pair of Taita Falcons in the region was recorded on the Drakensberg Escarpment in Mpumalanga in the late 1980s (Jenkins et al. 1991). Since then, incidental observations and two formal surveys of the same area have added a further 7-8 occupied nesting territories (Jenkins 2007, Jenkins et al. 2011a). The known regional population is c. 20 mature individuals; the actual population is unlikely to exceed 50 mature individuals (AR Jenkins pers. comm.). Confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population, in the absence of clear evidence of widespread declines or substantial threats, is thought to be stable (BirdLife International 2014d), although there is reason to believe that the Zimbabwe and Ugandan populations are substantially smaller now than they were 20 years ago (AR Jenkins per. comm.). The regional population is believed to be stable (Jenkins et al. 2011a). Confidence in this regional population trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is largely restricted to well-wooded habitats, and to mountains or incised river valleys where high, sheer rock faces are available as nesting and foraging sites (Jenkins et al. 2011a). The only comprehensive information on regional population size, diet and breeding performance originates from Zimbabwe (Hartley et al. 1993, Hartley 2000), where breeding success is generally poor. Estimates of certain key life-history parameters are derived from small samples of captive birds, suggesting that the reproductive potential of the species is low (Hartley et al. 1993). The species preys mainly on small (10-20 g) passerines (Hartley 2000).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to Taita Falcons in the region is transformation of mature, productive woodland into open habitat (AR Jenkins pers. comm.). Incidents of inter-specific aggression between Taita Falcon and Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus, Lanner Falcon Falco biarmicus, Verreauxs’ Eagle Aquila verreauxii, Brown Snake-Eagle Circaetus cinereus, and Jackal Buzzard Buteo rufofuscus have been recorded (Jenkins et al. 2011a). The larger, and more dominant, Lanner Falcon more than likely outcompetes Taita Falcons for prey and nest sites, and may prey on flying young. The spraying of organochlorine pesticides may have reduced numbers in northern Zimbabwe (BirdLife International 2014d) and, given the close proximity of commercial farming activities to its range in South Africa, should be considered a threat.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No 7 of 2003. </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Conservation measures will be determined by the research questions proposed. Special emphasis should be placed on research into the potential effects of pesticides. In addition, it is critical that suitable habitat within its range and, in particular, the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, is adequately protected. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the elusive and poorly known White-winged Flufftail Sarothrura ayresi has been estimated to be &lt;50 mature individuals, which satisfies the population criterion for regionally Critically Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Reason for Inclusion in the Assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of the species falls within the region. In addition, the species was listed as globally Critically Endangered in 2015 and as regionally Critically Endangered in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no recognised subspecies and no notable issues. </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">13.5-14.5 cm, 32 g. In flight, the white secondary flight feathers are a diagnostic feature of both sexes. Both sexes have white bellies and black and rufous barred tail. Adult male has whitish throat with rufous head and neck, and is darker brown on crown. Adult female has a darkish crown with greyish rufous on the sides of the head with some pale brown on the sides of the base of the neck, and a white throat. Immature male differs from adult male by having less rufous on head. Immature female similar to adult female, but paler and browner on upperparts (Taylor 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-winged Flufftail is regularly recorded from three sites in the Ethiopian Highlands near Addis Ababa and eight sites within the region (Taylor 2005). Breeding has been confirmed only for the Ethiopian population (Taylor 2005). In South Africa, since 1995, the White-winged Flufftail has been recorded at two sites in KwaZulu-Natal (Franklin and Hebron), four sites in north-eastern Free State (Seekoeivlei, Vanger, Murphy's Rust and Bedford/Chatsworth) and from two sites in eastern Mpumalanga (Lakenvlei and Wakkerstroom) (Taylor 2005). Franklin Vlei is extensively degraded and unlikely to contain any White-winged Flufftails at present (M Drummond pers. comm.). White-winged Flufftails disappeared from Seekoeivlei after the raising of the dam wall, and subsequent flooding removed all suitable habitat (Taylor 2000a). Between 2001-2004, Allan et al. (2006) did not locate any White-winged Flufftails in Franklin, Hebron, Vanger, Murphy's Rust, Bedford/Chatsworth or Wakkerstroom wetlands. In 2003, a single male White-winged Flufftail was observed in flight at Wakkerstroom (SW Evans pers. obs.). White-winged Flufftails may still be present at only two to eight of the 10 sites at which it was previously recorded. AoO is considered &lt;10 km2. All eight sites that in the past and currently contain White-winged Flufftails are part of the IBA network (Barnes 1998) but this does not necessarily grant immunity from harmful development. None of the sites in South Africa where the bird has been recorded are formally protected under provincial or national legislation. Wakkerstroom (within IBA SA020) is without official legal status or protection. Ingula is in the process of being proclaimed as a nature reserve. Middelpunt, contained within Steenkampsberg (IBA SA016), is threatened by diamond mining.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been estimated at 700 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014e) although this is believed to be an overestimate. The regional population was previously estimated to be in the region of 200-250 mature individuals (Taylor 2000a, Taylor and Grundling 2003, Taylor 2005). Due to the low confidence and data deficiency, as well as the current threats to the species in the past 10 years, it is believed that the regional population is now probably &lt;50 mature individuals. However, confidence in this regional population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There is inadequate information on the population status of this species to derive any form of population trend.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">White-winged Flufftails are found in high-altitude marshes (1 100-1 900 masl) (Taylor and Grundling 2003). These permanent marshes are shallowly flooded and dominated by dense sedges (Carex spp.), often mixed with other vegetation (Cyperus fastigiatus, Phragmites australis, Typha capensis, Leersia hexandra, Schoenoplectus spp.) (Taylor 2005). The birds occasionally co-occur in the same habitat as Red-chested Flufftails S. rufa (Taylor 2005). The White-winged Flufftail's monospecific status and absence of breeding records from South Africa have been considered indicative of long-distance migration between Ethiopia and South Africa (Taylor 2000a).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to White-winged Flufftails is loss or reduction in quality of their sensitive wetland habitat (Drummond et al. 2003, Taylor 2005). A reduction in habitat quality has been caused by mining activities, commercial plantations of exotic trees, eutrophication, erosion due to overgrazing of vegetation caused by excessive livestock stocking rates, siltation, incorrect burning methods and timing, changed hydrology caused by water abstraction, the influx of invasive species and the construction of fences and roads (de Smidt and Evans 2003). Loss of wetland habitat has been caused by the construction of dams, draining of wetlands, agriculture and mining (de Smidt and Evans 2003). The aforementioned threats are ongoing, with coal and diamond mining activities in particular threatening the loss and quality of habitat (M Drummond pers. comm.). Secondary threats to the species and its habitat include the disturbance of adult birds due to trampling by people and livestock. The migratory status of the species is unknown but is currently being investigated; if indeed proved to be migratory, the regional population could be affected by similar or additional threats on their migratory routes and in Ethiopia, which will require a wider conservation approach.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Action plans for White-winged Flufftails in Ethiopia and South Africa were compiled in 2003 (Drummond et al. 2003). Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Board are currently in process of having the Wakkerstroom Wetland (within IBA SA020) proclaimed a nature reserve in terms of Mpumalanga provincial conservation legislation (B Morris pers. comm.). The Middelpunt Wetland, part of Lakenvlei in the Steenkampsberg IBA (SA 016), is privately owned and currently managed by Middelpunt Wetland Trust (since 1995) to conserve White-winged Flufftails (M Drummond pers. comm.). BirdLife South Africa is involved in on-site research and monitoring at Ingula (Bedford/Chatsworth IBA SA043) and provides advice to Eskom to ensure that the construction activities will not adversely affect the birds or their habitat. In addition, Ingula is in process of being proclaimed a nature reserve. Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife is developing a habitat suitability model of the distribution of White-winged Flufftails in KwaZulu-Natal to identify potential sites at which the species may occur and that should be surveyed and potentially conserved (B Escott pers. comm.). The owner of Vanger had the site listed as a Natural Heritage Site, a designation that has subsequently been subsumed into the current conservation-stewardship programme. </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The South African White-winged Flufftail Action Plan should be reviewed and updated as it has been almost 10 years since it was first produced (de Smidt and Evans 2003). The appropriate provincial conservation authorities should be approached to have all eight sites at which the species has been recorded since 1995 formally conserved. Potential White-winged Flufftail habitats in the region should be identified, rehabilitated where required and conserved. Private owners of wetlands containing, or potentially containing White-winged Flufftails, should be assisted with protecting these sites by becoming part of relevant provincial conservation stewardship programmes. A programme to monitor the regional population should be developed and implemented. A Biodiversity Management Plan is required.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Leach's Storm Petrel Oceanodroma leucorhoa satisfies several criteria for regionally Critically Endangered status. The population size is estimated to number &lt;50 mature individuals. It has undergone a continuous decline of at least 25% within one generation, and a continuing, observed decline has been observed in numbers of mature individuals. In addition, no sub-population is estimated to contain more than 50 mature individuals, and at least 90% of mature individuals occur in a single sub-population. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Dassen Island birds currently represent the only breeding colony of Leach's Storm Petrel in the southern hemisphere. It is reproductively isolated from migratory non-breeding birds and, in accordance with the IUCN criteria, is assessed as a separate taxon.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Four subspecies occur globally, with O. l. leucorhoa occurring throughout the species' range in the region.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">19-22 cm, 40-50 g. Sexes alike. Head, neck and upperparts blackish brown with paler underparts. Rump white, sometimes bisected by indistinct grey line. Tail blackish and forked. Innermost secondaries, inner greater, median and outer secondary coverts with pale tips and edges, forming pale bar across upperwing. Bill, legs and feet black. Eyes brown. (Crawford and Underhill 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The nominate subspecies breeds during the boreal summer at islands in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans dispersing over tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans (Ryan and Whittington 1997). It is a common summer visitor to the deeper waters off the west and south coasts of southern Africa but scarce off the continental shelf (Ryan and Whittington 1997). Breeding in South Africa has been confirmed at two locations: Dassen and Dyer islands (Whittington et al. 1999). The two sites represent the only known breeding locations in the Southern Hemisphere (Kemper et al. 2007) although the use of offshore islands and predominantly nocturnal activity of breeding birds could raise the question of other southern hemisphere breeding sites yet to be discovered (Ryan and Whittington 1997). All four of the islands are part of the IBA network. Jutten and St Croix islands fall within National Parks, one of which is also a Ramsar site, while both Dassen Island and Dyer Island are Provincial Nature Reserves.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been estimated at 10 million pairs (Brooke 2004). The sedentary breeding population on South Africa's offshore islands is treated separately from the non-breeding migratory population. Birds were first confirmed breeding in South Africa in 1996 at Dyer Island (Whittington et al. 1999) although 17 birds were detected on this island in 1995. There were c. 20 pairs at Dyer Island in 1998, with breeding also taking place at Dassen Island (Crawford et al. 2012a). Breeding ceased at Dyer Island in 2005 (Crawford et al. 2012a) with only a small population of five pairs remaining at Dassen Island. The regional population is estimated at c. 10 mature individuals. The confidence in this regional population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is considered stable (BirdLife International 2014f), while the regional population is experiencing a decline. The number of pairs breeding decreased from an average of 18 during 1995/96-1999/2000 to an average of six from 2002/03-2006/07 (Kemper et al. 2007). In 2005 and 2006, breeding was reported to have ceased at Dyer Island and was only reported at Dassen Island (Kemper et al. 2007). The confidence in regional population trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Occurring singly or in small groups, Leach's Storm Petrel feeds mainly on planktonic crustaceans, small fish, squid and, at times, offal discards from commercial fishing boats (Watanuki 1985). Foraging takes place both during the day and at night (Pitman and Ballance 1990). It is a colonial, monogamous breeder with pair bonds lasting several years. In South Africa, nests are located in cavities in dry stonewalls (Whittington et al. 1999). Breeding takes place from November through to February. A generation length of 13 years is provided (BirdLife International 2014f).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to Leach's Storm Petrel occurs during the initial phases of prospecting for potential nest burrows and mates, principally from capture by avian predators, such as Kelp Gulls; in addition, it is potentially also predated upon by domestic cats Felis catus (Underhill et al. 2002). Additional threats include potential disturbance at breeding sites due to island based tourism, a lack of suitable protected breeding sites and occupation of favoured breeding sites (dry stonewalls) by cormorants. </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation measures are underway. Dassen Island is listed as a Provincial Nature Reserve established under Section 6 the Nature Conservation Ordinance, 1974, on 9 March 1998 and proclaimed in the Provincial Gazette of 18 March 1988 by Proclamation No. 23/1988.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan. The provision of artificial nestboxes to increase the number of suitable nesting sites should be considered, as this may be a limitation to the size of the population. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Crozet Shag Phalacrocorax [atriceps] melanogenis satisfies the criterion for regionally Critically Endangered under the reduction in population size criterion (an observed population size reduction of 80% over the last three generations based on direct observation).</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">South Africa's Prince Edward Islands support c. 230 pairs of Crozet Shags equating to roughly 22% of the global population. Elsewhere, the species breeds only at the Crozet Islands, where the population numbers c. 825 pairs (Jouventin et al. 1984). Listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Crozet Shag Phalacrocorax melanogenis forms part of the Imperial Cormorant P. atriceps  superspecies complex. Following the precautionary principle, it has been treated as a separate species. Further research is required to resolve the taxonomic status of this complex.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">70 cm, 2.0-2.6 kg. The only cormorant recorded from the Crozet and Prince Edward Island archipelagos. Adults blue-black above and white below. Long white wing bar in the upperwings. Bill is black. Gular skin a dirty yellow. Caruncles on forehead bright yellow. Iris brown with bright blue fleshy eye-ring. Feet pink. Immatures and juveniles generally brown backed and lack distinct colour on the face. Iris brown and eye ring grey. Birds usually silent at sea, but utter a contact honk, similar to King Penguins, periodically while foraging. (Marchant and Higgins 1990).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Found only at the Crozet and Prince Edward Island archipelagos in the south-west Indian Ocean.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In 2008/09, 81 pairs of Crozet Shag bred at Prince Edward Island (Crawford et al. 2009a). In 2012/13, 148 pairs bred at Marion Island (Department of Environmental Affairs unpubl. data). The present population at South Africa's Prince Edward Islands is therefore c. 230 pairs. The confidence in this population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In the 1951/52 breeding season, there were at least 178 nests at Marion Island (Crawford et al. 2003a). In 1987/88, 589 pairs bred at Marion Island (Cooper and Brown 1990). In 1994/95, regular monitoring of numbers of Crozet Shags breeding at Marion Island commenced. In that season, 841 pairs bred decreasing to 344 pairs in 2001/02 (Crawford et al. 2003a) and to 220 pairs in 2003/04 (Crawford et al. 2009a). Numbers then increased to 598 pairs in 2006/07, before decreasing again to 148 pairs in 2012/13, the lowest count yet recorded (Crawford et al. 2009a, 2014). Numbers breeding at Marion Island decreased by 82% between 1994/95 and 2012/13, a period of 18 years. The decrease between 1987/88 and 2012/13 was 75% in 25 years or 2.2 generations, equivalent to greater than 80% in three generations. In 1984, 120 pairs were recorded breeding on Prince Edward Island decreasing by 33% to 81 pairs in 2008. The confidence in this trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Crozet Shags breed coastally on cliff ledges and rock stacks at 37 sites around Marion Island (in 2013/14 breeding was reported from only nine sites) and at 10 sites around Prince Edward Island. Breeding takes place in summer (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Nests are built with grass (BM Dyer pers. obs.). Age at first breeding is three years (Crawford et al. 2003a) with average breeding success ranging from 0.07-1.28 chicks fledged per pair (Crawford et al. 2009a). The average generation for Crozet Shags is 11.3 years (BirdLife International 2014g). The species forages within about 400 m of the shore, mainly on the seabed (Blankley 1981) with the diet consisting mainly of fish, cephalopods and a decapod shrimp (Blankley 1981, Espitalier-Noel et al. 1988, Crawford et al. 2003a).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Decreases at Marion Island have been influenced by poor breeding success (Crawford et al. 2003a, 2009a). Numbers breeding between 1994/95 and 2012/13 were significantly correlated with numbers of Gentoo Penguins breeding at Marion Island (r=0.799, n=19, p&lt;0.001, Crawford et al. 2014). The two species have similar foraging distributions and diets and their decreases may have been influenced by reduced food availability (Crawford et al. 2003a, 2009a, 2009c). Antarctic Fur Seals Arctocephalus gazella populations are increasing at both Marion and Prince Edward islands (Bester et al. 2009) and their predation on Crozet Shags is a potential threat, as is that on eggs and chicks. Crozet Shags may be disturbed by humans in close proximity and by helicopters, particularly during breeding. There is a small but non-trivial risk of diesel spills while offloading fuel on relief voyages.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There is no access to the Prince Edward Islands without a permit issued by South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs. At Marion Island, breeding sites are categorised according to the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan as Zone 4. This is the strictest conservation area; no helicopter movement is permitted overhead, no casual access permitted and only limited research allowed. There are no visits to Prince Edward Island except for bona fide research and conservation purposes every 4-5 years. There are strict guidelines in place to avoid diesel spills at sea.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Monitoring of numbers breeding and breeding success at Marion Island should continue. The population census at Prince Edward Island should continue at intervals of about five years. Restrictions regarding access to breeding sites should remain in place.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Blue Swallow Hirundo atrocaerulea satisfies the population size criteria for regionally Critically Endangered (population numbers &lt;250 individuals and a decline of at least 25% is predicted in the next three years). </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this intra-African migrant occurs within the region. In addition, it was listed as regionally Critically Endangered in 2000 and is current listed as globally Vulnerable. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The results of a phylogenetic analysis of the genus Hirundo indicate that the Blue Swallow is most closely related to the Black-and-rufous Swallow Hirundo nigrorufa (Dor et al. 2010). There is currently no support for the placement of the Blue Swallow in the monospecific genus Natalornis by Roberts (1940).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">20-25 cm, 14 g. Adult male Blue Swallow is wholly glossy steel-blue. Birds with worn plumage show more violet than steel-blue. The outer tail feathers are narrow and considerably elongated, with no white spots in the tail. Variable white patches on the sides and flanks conspicuous on resting birds, but otherwise concealed. The adult female Blue Swallow is slightly duller and slightly smaller than the male, with shorter outer tail-feathers. Immature Blue Swallows are rusty black to sooty black in appearance, less glossy blue-black than the adults, with white mottling visible on the flanks. Young birds have outer tail feathers without the filamentous tip to tail streamers similar to that of females, with the streamers always much shorter than in males. (Mackworth-Praed and Grant 1955, Spottiswoode 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Blue Swallow is an African endemic and an intra-African migrant in sub-Saharan Africa (Keith et al. 1992). This bird breeds in South Africa, western Swaziland, eastern Zimbabwe, western Mozambique, Malawi, north-eastern Zambia, southern Tanzania and south-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo from September to April (Turner and Rose 1989, Evans and Bouwman 2010a). During the non-breeding season (May to August), Blue Swallows migrate to western Kenya, southern Uganda, north-western Tanzania, and north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (Turner and Rose 1989, Evans and Bouwman 2010a). In South Africa, the species is restricted to grasslands of the Eastern Escarpment. In KwaZulu-Natal, the northern and southern limits of the breeding range are Impendle and Harding respectively, with the majority of birds breeding in the Ixopo district. In Swaziland, all suitable Blue Swallow habitats are located along the western part of the country above 1 200 masl (Parker 1994, Monadjem et al. 2006). Recent confirmed breeding events occurred in Malolotja Nature Reserve, Sibebe Mountains, and Mahlangatsha (Parker 1994, Monadjem et al. 2003, Monadjem et al. 2006). The Blue Swallow's range in South Africa and Swaziland has contracted by 74% from 1890 to 2005 (Evans and Bouwman 2010a). Blue Swallows have disappeared from 21 of 29 known sites between 1880 and 1987 (Allan et al. 1997b). By the end of the 1980s, the four pairs in Blinkwater Nature Reserve were locally extinct (Evans and Barnes 2000). In the 1990s, Blue Swallow pairs in the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve and along the Mac-Mac Escarpment had become locally extinct (Evans and Bouwman 2010a). By the end of the 2000s, the most recent local extinctions were the loss of two pairs in Misty Mountain Natural Heritage Site, the last two remaining pairs near Nongoma, in northern KwaZulu-Natal and nine pairs in the Blue Swallow Natural Heritage Site. The few pairs near Nongoma were the only Blue Swallows in the region occupying the Northern Zululand Mistbelt Grassland vegetation type. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at c. 2 000 mature individuals (Evans and Bouwman 2010b). In 2000, there were estimated to be a maximum of 240 mature individuals within the region (Evans and Barnes 2000). Only four nests are known from Mpumalanga and approximately 16 and 33 in Swaziland and KwaZulu-Natal, respectively (IT Little pers. comm.). The regional population is estimated at 53 pairs or 106 mature individuals. Confidence in this regional population estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is in decline (BirdLife International 2014h) with the regional population showing a similar trend, decreasing by 52.4% over the past three generations (2000 to 2011). It is believed that this decline is continuous and will be greater than 25% within one generation length (3 years). Confidence in this regional trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In South Africa and Swaziland, Blue Swallows have been recorded from 760 masl, in the southern part of their range, to a maximum of 1 760 masl in the northern parts of their range (Allan et al. 1987, Monadjem et al. 2003). Blue Swallow nest sites are located within high-altitude, high-rainfall (greater than 1 000 mm per year), undulating, open, primary mist-belt grasslands with a sward height of &lt;0.5 m (Allan et al. 1987, Monadjem et al. 2003, Evans 2010, Evans and Bouwman 2010a). The generation lengths for female and male Blue Swallows are approximately 2.6 and 3 years, respectively (SW Evans unpubl. data). Mean age at first reproduction for female and male Blue Swallows is one and two years of age, respectively (Evans et al. 2002). For both males and females, mortality from ages 0-1 and 1 onwards was estimated to be approximately 50% and 10%, respectively (SW Evans unpubl. data). Maximum age of reproduction for males and females is approximately 4 years (SW Evans unpubl. data). In Mpumalanga, Blue Swallows significantly prefer wetlands to grasslands for foraging (Evans 2010, Evans and Bouwman 2010a) although in KwaZulu-Natal, Wakelin (2006) found that Blue Swallows preferred to forage in the ecotone between grasslands and wetlands. The minimum home range size is approximately 3.3 km2, consisting, at a minimum, of grasslands (2.4 km2 or 73%) and wetlands, including drainage lines (0.9 km2 or 27%) (Evans and Bouwman 2010a). An area of grassland with no drainage lines or other wetlands is considered unlikely to support any Blue Swallow pairs, probably owing to a lack of food (Evans and Bouwman 2010a).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The highest priority threats, resulting in habitat degradation and conversion, are afforestation, large-scale and subsistence agriculture, invasion by alien eucalyptus, pine and wattle trees, (Allan et al. 1987, Wakelin and Hill 2007), rural population growth, and inappropriate management and drainage of wetlands (Evans et al. 2002, Evans 2010). Inappropriate farming methods lead to soil erosion (Monadjem et al. 2003). The drainage of wetlands for cultivation and road construction remains a serious threat (Evans 1996, 2008, Evans and Bouwman 2010a) while mining represents a threat of moderate to high importance (Kemper and Niemand 1992, Evans 1996, 2008). Overgrazing and overburning, which reduces substrate for insects upon which Blue Swallows feed, are threats (A Marchant pers. comm.). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The process of sinkhole formation, upon which Blue Swallows rely on for nesting sites, may be negatively affected by timber forests drying out underground streams (Snell 1969). Fragmentation of grasslands, as a result of grassland transformation, may result in Aardvark Orycteropus afer not getting to potentially suitable sites to dig holes that can be used by the birds. The snaring of Aardvark has led to a decline in local populations (Marchant 2012), thereby also influencing the number of holes available for the birds. Tarboton (1992) demonstrated the importance of sufficient altitudinal range over which to forage during mist periods for the survival of Blue Swallows near Graskop. The loss of foraging habitat at lower elevations that were less often enveloped in mist, as compared to the higher-altitude breeding and foraging habitat, results in the birds being unable to find sufficient food and prolonged poor weather conditions adversely affecting breeding success (Evans and Bouwman 2010a). Uncoordinated small-scale ecotourism developments have resulted in loss of Blue Swallow nesting sites in South Africa (Evans 1997). In areas where Blue Swallows coexist in proximity to agricultural crops, the use of insecticides may affect aerial insect prey availability to Blue Swallows (Evans et al. 2002). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As a migrant species, Blue Swallow populations are not only affected by threats on their breeding grounds in South Africa and Swaziland, but also on their migratory routes and in their non-breeding range in Uganda (Evans and Bouwman 2010a, Wakelin et al. 2011). Swallows migrate by day and feed en route (Turner and Rose 1989). A loss of habitat along their migratory routes may result in there being less food available to the birds on migration, resulting in an increase in mortality of these birds, and, in turn, resulting in fewer birds returning to South Africa and Swaziland to breed. In addition, a reduction of habitat suitable for Blue Swallows in their non-breeding range would result in an increase in mortality and fewer birds returning to breed (Evans et al. 2002). A lesser threat is competition for nest holes between Banded Martin and Blue Swallow, which may become more relevant as the habitat shrinks and nest holes become fewer (A Marchant pers. comm.).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">An International Action Plan and South African Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) was completed for the Blue Swallow in 2002 (Evans et al. 2002). Over the past 10 years, research into the extent of the decline of the Blue Swallow population in South Africa, and further afield in Africa, has been completed (Evans and Bouwman 2010a). Research into the habitat requirements of Blue Swallows in South Africa has also been conducted (Wakelin 2006, Evans and Bouwman 2010a). Initial research into the migratory linkages between Blue Swallows' breeding and non-breeding ranges has been undertaken (Evans and Bouwman 2010b, Wakelin et al. 2011) although certain aspects, including stop-over sites, still need to be investigated. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are several stakeholders involved in Blue Swallow conservation. Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife is mandated by the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government to coordinate efforts to protect this species and does so through a provincial Blue Swallow Monitoring Programme. The Blue Swallow Working Group of the Endangered Wildlife Trust, now part of the Threatened Grassland Species Programme, contributes to the development of conservation policy, legislation and advocacy for the protection of threatened grassland species including the Blue Swallow. The group also undertakes research and monitoring into the habitat requirements and population trends of the species, education and awareness campaigns. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">All localities known to contain breeding Blue Swallows in South Africa are designated as Important Bird Areas (Barnes 1998). The Blue Swallow is listed in Appendix I and II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. It is listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No 7 of 2003. The Blue Swallow is listed as Critically Endangered in Swaziland and is protected by the Swaziland Game Act (Monadjem et al. 2003).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Conservation of both the breeding and non-breeding range of the Blue Swallow population in South Africa and Swaziland is crucial. Several priority actions, which were identified by Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="Bullets" lang="en-US">Increasing the amount of formally protected Mistbelt Grassland areas </li>
		<li class="Bullets" lang="en-US">Coordinated burning regimes which create a mosaic of different age classes with no block left unburnt for several years</li>
		<li class="Bullets" lang="en-US">Implementing appropriate grazing regimes</li>
		<li class="Bullets" lang="en-US">Remove alien plants in the vicinity of nest sites</li>
		<li class="Bullets" lang="en-US">Protect historical nest sites and habitat</li>
		<li class="Bullets" lang="en-US">Attempt incentive and compensation-based contractual agreements between provincial agencies and private land-owners to safeguard habitat </li>
		<li class="Bullets" lang="en-US">Create artificial nest holes where necessary and maintain existing nest holes</li>
		<li class="Bullets" lang="en-US">Rehabilitate of suitable areas that have undergone afforestation and agriculture. </li>
	</ul>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In addition, Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife have set the following targets to be achieved from these actions: 1) increasing and securing the KwaZulu-Natal Blue Swallow population to 80 active nests; 2) and achieving an average fledgling success rate of two per breeding event per year. The long-term objectives are to rehabilitate and secure the breeding population of Blue Swallow in KwaZulu-Natal to 156 active breeding pairs with an average fledgling success rate of two per breeding event per year (Marchant 2012). In addition, Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife has compiled a monitoring plan for Blue Swallow in the province (Marchant 2012) which should be used to update applicable sections of the International Blue Swallow Action Plan and the Population and Habitat Viability Assessment. Based on these documents a Biodiversity Management Plan must be developed for submission to the South African Department of Environmental Affairs which will provide greater legal support to the provincial conservation authorities and other institutions in their efforts to conserve the Blue Swallow and its habitat.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Damara Tern Sterna balaenarum satisfies the criterion for regionally Critically Endangered under the population-size criterion (population size estimated to number less than250 mature individuals and an estimated continuing decline of at least 25% within one generation).</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global range of this species lies within the region. The species was assessed as globally Near Threatened in 2012 and regionally Endangered in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No known issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">22-23 cm, 52 g. One of the smallest terns in the region. Adults have dark brown cap, appearing black in the field. Cap passes well below the blackish brown eye from base of the lower mandible. The remainder of upper body uniform grey. Tail, underwing and belly white. Outer primaries darker grey than the inners. Bill is black, sharply pointed and yellow at the base. Legs are dull yellow, but incorrectly depicted black in most field guides (Simmons 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species occurs in Angola, Namibia and South Africa (Crawford and Simmons 1997) with maximum densities occurring in the Walvis Bay region, Namibia, and decreasing uniformly to the north and south of this coastal town (Simmons et al. 1998). Distribution extends c. 150 km north into Angola, although only one breeding colony has been located 30 km north of the Cunene River (Simmons et al. 2010). During autumn migration, the majority of the population is distributed in West Africa, including Benin and Ghana, with Namibian ringed birds being recovered in Nigeria. Within the region, the species is traditionally confined to just 12 breeding localities from Alexander Bay, Northern Cape, to the Alexandria Dune Fields in Eastern Cape, but some are no longer used (Braby et al. 2011). The species is uncommon in South Africa, with perhaps the largest concentration occurring in the Alexandria Dune Fields, east of Port Eliza&#173;beth (Braby et al. 2011, Crawford et al. 2012a). Coastal distribution is probably related to small-fish availability as much as it is to breeding habitat, because higher densities of breeding terns occur where the greatest offshore productivity occurs (Simmons and Cordes 2000). The Damara Tern is found at five IBAs namely Orange River Mouth Wetlands (SA030), Woody Cape Section: Addo Elephant National Park (SA094), Overberg Wheatbelt (SA115), De Hoop Nature Reserve (SA119) and Heuningnes River and Estuary System (SA121).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 14 000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 9 300 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014i), although there is considerable variation in published estimates with several ranging from 930 pairs to 13 500 individuals (Simmons et al. 1998). A global estimate from 2011, which considered only breeding colonies, estimated between 1 001 and 2 685 pairs or 2 002 to 5 370 mature individuals (Braby 2011). Estimates differ due to different methods used (counting at colonies to random sampling across the entire range in Namibia). Within South Africa, Underhill (2000a) estimated 120-150 breeding pairs, although, according to Crawford et al. (2012a), this figure may have been optimistic. In 2011, Braby estimated there to be 52-88 pairs based on past and present counts and summations at active colonies in South Africa (Braby 2011). However, Crawford et al. (2012a) provided a lower estimate of c. 36 pairs breeding in the region based upon 4-11 pairs breeding at De Mond Reserve in Western Cape, and 25 pairs breeding in Eastern Cape (Crawford et al. 2009a). Confidence in this latter regional population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be stable (BirdLife International 2014i), However, disappearance of colonies along the central Namibian coast due to housing developments, and threats from off-road driving (Braby 2011) and diamond mining (Simmons 2005a), mean that a slow decline is likely. This is reflected in South Africa where a once thriving colony at Struis Bay (11-13 pairs in the early 2000s) has declined to 1-5 pairs by 2010 (N Hess pers. comm., J Huiseman pers. comm.), while a colony described in the 1990s as ‘sporadic and up to 20 pairs' (Braby 2011) at Dreyer's Pan, Kleinzee area, holds no birds presently (S Sutherland pers. comm., RE Simmons pers. obs.). This parallels the findings of Crawford et al. (2012a) whose surveys in 2009-11 revealed only 36 pairs. Even accounting for a possible overestimation of population size by Underhill (2000a), the decrease in the regional population has been substantial. An estimated, continuing decline of greater than 25% has likely occurred over three generations. Confidence in this trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Damara Terns occur along high-energy desert coasts during the non-breeding season and in sheltered bays and shallow reefs during the breeding season (Braby et al. 1992). Salt pans, gravel plains and gravel slacks close to the ocean are favoured nesting areas in South Africa (Watson and Kerley 1995, Underhill 2000a), while salt pans (southern Namibia) and large gravel plains (northern Namibia) are favoured elsewhere (Simmons et al. 1998). Damara Terns breed mainly from November to March, with variation according to location. The clutch size is typically a single egg (Braby 2011); this is unusual for small terns that more often lay two eggs. Nest location in Namibia is influenced by jackal activity: nests are located farther inland where density of jackal tracks at the coast is high (RE Simmons, R Heber-Percy and J Braby unpubl. data). In South Africa, jackals are less problematic and colonies tend to be closer to the ocean (J Cooper pers. comm.). Presence of jackals and humans influences success of nests; reducing disturbance can double the production of chicks in protected colonies (Williams et al. 2004, Braby et al. 2009). The species rarely roosts with other terns on the coast (Simmons et al. 2010). Long-term studies indicate that immature survival from fledging to adulthood is high at 0.59 and individuals start to breed at 3-4 years of age (Braby et al. 2011). Annual adult survival is high at 0.88 and the probability of a breeding bird moving to another colony is low at 0.06 (Braby et al. 2011). These statistics indicate that adult birds are long lived and are faithful to their breeding colonies. The generation length of 11 years is the mean of two calculated values derived from published and/or extrapolated estimates of mean age at first breeding, maximum longevity in the wild and mean annual adult survival (BirdLife International 2014i). Birds forage mainly over shallow water, often in bays, over reefs, or in salt works, probably because surf-zone fish are concentrated there and less often in open water (B Clark pers. comm.). Terns also plunge dive for fish behind breakers in the open ocean and may do so at night (Braby et al. 1992). Foraging birds tend to avoid murky, sediment-filled water in preference for clear water (Simmons and Braine 1994, Braby 2011). Damara Terns feed on small fish that are rarely longer than a bill length (3 cm), including needle fish (Tylosaurus species), larval blennies (Blennidae), Cape Silverside Atherina breviceps, and Cape Anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus (Clinning 1978, Simmons and Braine 1994, Braby 2011). </p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Off-road vehicle disturbance (leading to nest desertion), and direct fatalities due to crushed eggs and chicks, are the biggest threats to Damara Tern colonies (Braby et al. 2009). The banning of off-road vehicles on South African beaches has reduced such disturbance and increased breeding success (Williams et al. 2004). Semi-natural threats, such as increased jackal and gull densities due to human presence and the increasing numbers of seals and seal colonies in South Africa and Namibia, increase the likelihood of predation (Braby 2011). Natural threats to the terns, and other fish-eating species, come from possible consequences of global warming which may reduce winds driving the Benguela upwelling in turn affecting primary productivity and fish populations available to all marine species. The level of this threat is, however, hard to gauge. It may, conversely, bring increased El Niño oscillations and higher productivity to the Benguela system. Sand-swamping of eggs is the major cause of mortality in the Struis Bay colony (AJ Williams unpubl. data). The spread of non-indigenous, invasive vegetation may have affected some breeding sites in Western Cape (J Cooper pers. comm.) </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In South Africa, the Department of Environmental Affairs banned off-road vehicles from all beaches in 2001, which had an immediate positive effect on shorebirds in South Africa (Williams et al. 2004). Protection from vehicles had a similar effect on productivity in Namibia (Braby et al. 2009). </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) and Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan are recommended. Monitoring of populations needs to be undertaken and published. Given that disturbance and mining are probably the biggest source of mortality and colony abandonment, vigilance in keeping colonies undisturbed, and protecting them formally, are priorities for the few colonies remaining in South Africa.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus satisfies the population criterion for regionally Critically Endangered (population size estimated to number less than250 mature individuals and greater than 90% of mature individuals occurring in a single sub-population). In addition, a decline of 82.8% over the past three generations satisfies the criterion for regionally Critically Endangered, while a quantitative analysis shows the probability of extinction in the wild is at least 50% within the next three generations.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of Bearded Vulture occurs within the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Endangered in the 2000 assessment.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two subspecies are recognised (Mundy et al. 1992), with G. b. meridionalis occurring in the region. Phylogenetic analysis by Godoy et al. (2004) revealed the existence of two divergent mitochondrial lineages. Lineage A occurs mainly in western European populations and lineage B in African, eastern European and central Asian populations. The phylogeographic pattern suggests allopatric differentiation of the two lineages in separate Mediterranean and African or Asian glacial refugia, followed by range expansion from the latter leading to two secondary contact suture zones in central Europe and north Africa. Due to the marked genetic structure, extinction of central European populations in the past century resulted in the loss of a major portion of the genetic diversity for the species. Krüger et al. (2015) confirm low genetic diversity in the regional population.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">110 cm, 5.7 kg. Sexes are alike although females may be slightly larger. A huge and spectacular raptor, with a characteristic silhouette when flying overhead. Adult appears as a dark bird with blonde head. Head fully feathered, with prominent eye and beard tuft; lacks a supra-orbital ridge. Facial mask black around the eye, extending downwards over the nostrils and cere to end in a bristly beard. Belly colour varies from almost white to bright orange, depending on level of iron oxide staining. Whole of underbody, feathered leggings and long undertail coverts orange to rufous. Upper body dark slate-grey. Flight feathers blackish. Tail feathers plain dark brown with contrasting white quills. Juvenile dark brown; feathered mane blackish. Eyes slightly opaque, pale yellow-brown; eye-ring changes from opaque brown-red at 8 months to opaque dull red. Tail and flight feathers plain dark brown, paler along shafts and tipped buff (Piper 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species occurs in Europe, Asia and Africa (Mundy et al. 1992). The subspecies barbatus occurs north of the Tropic of Cancer in Africa, Europe, and Asia while meridionalis occurs only south of the Tropic of Cancer in Ethiopia, East Africa and southern Africa. The regional population is restricted to the highlands of Lesotho and South Africa along the Drakensberg Escarpment of eastern KwaZulu-Natal, north-eastern Eastern Cape and north-eastern Free State. Historically the species has lost c. 40% of its former range in the southern and south-western Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces (Boshoff et al. 1978, Brown 1991a). The species is restricted to Alpine, Sour and mixed grasslands on rugged mountains and escarpments at an altitude of greater than 1 500 m. The birds forage along ridges and valleys in protected areas, but range out over communal and commercial lands. Adult birds appear to avoid areas of human habitation (Mundy et al. 1992). Home ranges of breeding adults did not vary in size between seasons but adults utilised their home range more intensively whilst breeding, moving greater distances during the incubation and chick hatching period (Krüger et al. 2014a). Young birds wander widely, but concentrate in areas of low adult densities, i.e. nursery areas (Mundy et al. 1992, Krüger et al. 2014a). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at 1 300-6 700 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014j). There are two isolated populations in Africa, one in Ethiopia (c. 4 000 pairs) and Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania (c. 50 pairs) and an isolated sub-population in the region. The regional population, which is a distinct sub-population, is estimated at 352-390 birds of which c. 200 are mature individuals (Krüger et al. 2014b). The current estimate is based on known nest sites rather than estimated number of nest sites. Confidence in the regional population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species is declining throughout its global range, with the exception of northern Spain, where it has increased since 1986 (BirdLife International 2014j). The regional population suffered a decline of nearly 40% in its distribution range from the 1700s until 1969 (Boshoff et al. 1978). In 1991, Brown estimated the breeding population to be in the region of 204 pairs: 122 in Lesotho and 82 in South Africa (Brown 1991a). In the 1990s, Colahan and Esterhuizen (1997) found no breeding pairs in Free State, and Maphisa (1997) noted that sightings in the lowlands of Lesotho were rare and some nest sites were abandoned. The present regional population is estimated at c. 200 mature individuals (Krüger et al. 2014b). Based upon Brown's (1991) and more recently estimate by Krüger et al. (2014c), the decline over the past three generations, or 53 years, is 82.8%. The Vortex (9.9b) population model was used to simulate the extinction process with models predicting a negative growth rate for the population over the next 50 years with a high probability (0.89) of extinction as a result of low survival estimates (particularly for adults; 86%) and reduced productivity (55%). To achieve a positive growth rate, mortality rates would need to be reduced by greater than 50% and productivity increased by greater than 25%. The confidence in this regional population trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Survival of fledglings up to age four was 12% (an average annual survival rate of 59%), while adult survival 95% per year (Mundy et al. 1992). There is no evidence to suggest that the survival rates of males and females differ. Adults make up 60% of the population (Krüger et al. 2014b). A generation length of 17.8 years was provided by Birdlife International (2014j). The diet consists mainly of bones from both fresh and old carcasses; they prefer bone to fresh meat, but require red meat to feed nestlings (Brown and Plug 1990). The species is well-adapted to handle and process bones, including in having a wide gape of c. 70 mm which allows bones of up to 250 mm long by 35 mm thick to be swallowed, and digestion can proceed with part of the bone sitting in the throat or even still protruding from the mouth (Mundy et al. 1992).The species is a solitary, winter-nester, and usually raises only a single nestling per breeding attempt. The substantial stick-nest, lined with wool and fur, is placed on a cliff, usually in a pothole or small cave. Pairs have 2-5 additional nests that are used in alternate years (Piper 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat is poisoning with 42% of tracked birds (n=21) being killed due to poison ingestion (Krüger 2014c). Poisoning incidents are mainly indirect, with jackals being the primary target. Electrocution and collisions with power-lines are an additional major threat. Since it is difficult to find carcasses in remote, mountainous terrain, the number of mortalities due to collisions is assumed to be far greater than  recorded (SC Krüger pers. obs.). An increase in the electrification of the Lesotho Highlands, in conjunction with current electrification networks of the lowlands of South Africa, is likely to cause collisions to increase (SC Krüger pers. obs.) A further threat is a reduction in food supply caused by a loss of natural ungulates, superior animal husbandry practices and improved animal hygiene (Boshoff et al. 1983). Bearded Vulture mortalities due to gin traps have been recorded in the Free State (Colahan 2004) and Lesotho (Maphisa 1997), but is considered a lesser threat. The intensity of disturbance by people may be increasing because of better access to the interior of Lesotho for the Lesotho Highlands Development Project; many new roads around Katse and Mohale dams allow people and development to move into much of the Lesotho Highlands (Maphisa 1997). Although the threat of direct persecution may not be a current one in South Africa, an increase in the number of firearms in Lesotho may see an increase in incidents (Maphisa 1997). Vultures are an important component in prognostication (e.g. predicting the outcomes of horse races, political elections) in traditional medicine. The skin as well as plumage have been known to be used for ceremonial purposes in southern Africa. The birds are reputed to be used as food in Lesotho (Maphisa 1997). Fires below nesting cliffs, especially if extensive, intensive and of long duration, may influence breeding success.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Bearded Vulture Task Force coordinates conservation efforts in the region to ensure collaboration between Lesotho and South Africa in implementing actions identified during the Bearded Vulture PHVA workshop held in March 2006. The Bearded Vulture Task Force drafted a Biodiversity Management Plan which was gazetted in May 2014 (Krüger 2013). Current conservation activities include monitoring of nest sites, breeding success, ranging behaviour, population age structure and habitat use. An annual count day, which has a dual purpose of monitoring and awareness raising, is held on the first Saturday of September every year.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The action plan section of the Biodiversity Management Plan contains 16 objectives and 107 action steps. A summary of these objectives and action steps is as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="Bullets" lang="en-US">&#9;Supplement natural carcass availability through an intensive feeding programme, i.e. feeding sites that are well located, effectively managed, and provide a safe food source for Bearded Vultures.</li>
		<li class="Bullets" lang="en-US">&#9;Ensure integration of Bearded Vulture conservation planning into existing land-use planning systems, EIA processes and stewardship programmes to mitigate the current and potential impacts of infrastructural developments and tourism activities.</li>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus is estimated to number less than250 mature individuals with an estimated continuing decline of at least 25% within one generation, satisfying the criterion C1 for Critically Endangered. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The formally threatened status of the Hooded Vulture in the region dates to the second South African Red Data Book which categorised it as ‘Rare' (Brooke 1984), a ranking roughly similar to ‘Near Threatened' in the current IUCN categorisations. In the third regional Red Data Book this was upgraded to ‘Vulnerable' (Barnes 2000a). This vulture was first considered globally threatened in 2011 when it was remarkably upgraded from Least Concern directly to Endangered (BirdLife International 2014k), and to Critically Endangered in 2015.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two subspecies, the nominate in West Africa and N. m. pileatus in East and southern Africa, are accepted by some authorities (Brown et al. 1982, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) but not others (Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">70 cm, 1.8-2.6 kg. Sexes alike. The Hooded Vulture is characterised by its diminutive size, small head and thin beak. Crown, face and foreneck bare pinkish. Hindneck with woolly buff-grey down. Upperparts, underparts and short, rounded tail blackish brown. Crop patch greyish, bordered by V-shaped patch of white down. Feathering on legs white, and typically shows some white on the abdomen as well. Remiges with whitish bases to inner webs, and undersides of secondaries paler, creating a distinctive silvery when seen in flight from below. Bill black with pinkish cere. Eyes black, eye-ring blue. Legs and feet pale greenish blue. Juveniles and immatures are duller, with dark leggings and abdomen, and the underwing lacks any silvery sheen. When seen in flight and at distance, however, care must be taken not to confuse the Hooded Vulture with the similarly dark-coloured Lappet-faced Vulture Torgos tracheliotus and White-headed Vulture Aegypius occipitalis (Mundy et al. 1992, Allan 2000a, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The juveniles and immatures of these three species are particularly prone to being confused.</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Hooded Vulture now occurs regularly only in the north-eastern regions of South Africa, where it is confined to the conservation areas in the Lowveld of Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces (Mundy 1997a). It is only an occasional vagrant to other parts of the region, e.g. eastern Swaziland (Monadjem 2004a) and the Zululand region of KwaZulu-Natal Province (Rushworth and Piper 2004). There is a recent record of a vagrant bird in the Eastern Cape Province (Boshoff 2008). Its distribution in South Africa is known to be much reduced from earlier times (Boshoff et al. 1983, Tarboton and Allan 1984, Mundy 1997a). The restricted distribution in the region, however, appears similar between the SABAP1 and SABAP2.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The current global population is estimated at a maximum of 197 000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014k). The breeding range of the Hooded Vulture in the region probably extended more widely in the past but there is a lack of historical breeding records to directly confirm this (Boshoff et al. 1983, Tarboton and Allan 1984) and it is now restricted as a breeding species to the Kruger National Park and Adjacent Private Nature Reserves (Tarboton and Allan 1984, Mundy 1997a, Roche 2006). The population in this area was estimated at less than50 pairs in the late 1970s (Tarboton and Allan 1984), although this was considered likely an underestimate by Benson (1997). The figure was revised to 50-100 pairs in the late 1990s (Barnes and Tarboton 1998). Kemp et al. (2001) estimated at least 64 breeding adults in the Kruger National Park. Nests of this vulture in southern Africa, unlike other large vulture species, are typically hidden under the canopies of well-foliaged trees (Mundy et al. 1992) and are thus difficult to find and count, rendering a survey of breeding pairs challenging. The total regional population estimate therefore remains essentially unchanged from the previous assessment (Anderson 2000b), i.e. 50-100 breeding pairs (i.e. 100-200 mature individuals). Confidence in this regional population estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is believed to have undergone a large-scale, and in some cases apparently rapid, decrease across its broad African range over the past 40-50 years and in some areas in less than 20 years (Ogada and Buij 2011). As discussed above, the Hooded Vulture may have disappeared entirely as a breeding species over parts of the region since historical times, e.g. the central parts of the former Transvaal Province (Tarboton and Allan 1984), but direct historical evidence of this is even less available than in the Lappet-faced and White-headed vultures. As with those two species though, any large-scale historical reduction seems to have stabilised in modern times and the breeding range, now restricted entirely to Kruger National Park and Adjacent Private Nature Reserves, appears to have remained unchanged since the 1970s at least. Its presence in the region as a breeding bird therefore is entirely reliant on these protected areas. The regional population is stable. Confidence in this regional population trend is high. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The breeding biology of the Hooded Vulture is fairly well known (Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005b, Roche 2006, Tarboton 2011). The age of first breeding is 5-6 years with about 80% of pairs reported to breed each year. A generation length of 17.8 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014k). The species is monogamous. Nests are typically solitary in southern Africa but sometimes loosely colonial where the species occurs at densities higher than those usually found in southern Africa. Unlike the conspicuous nests of most other vultures in the region, Hooded Vulture nests are typically well hidden high up in densely foliaged trees, especially Jackal-berry Diospyros mespiliformis, often situated along watercourses. Nests are often re-used. The main egg-laying period spans June-July (May-October) with the clutch comprising of a single egg. Females may re-lay after early failure. Incubation is by both sexes and spans 50-51 days. The nestling period is 100-120 (90-130) days. The post-fledging dependence period is up to a further four months. Breeding success is reported at about 46%. The species is single brooded.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Hooded Vulture is a species of woodland habitats (Mundy et al. 1992, Mundy 1997a,b). It is a scavenger and regularly attends both large and small carcasses; other small offal such as droppings of Lions Panthera leo are also consumed. Like the Lappet-faced and White-headed vultures, it is usually outnumbered at large carcasses by Gyps vultures but gatherings at some large carcasses can be substantial (Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005b). Adults are thought to be largely sedentary and juveniles and immatures to wander more widely (Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005b). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As with the White-headed Vulture, the fact that the Hooded Vulture essentially disappeared unheralded from most of their breeding range outside large protected areas means that knowledge of the dangers underpinning this decrease in the region are extremely poorly documented. The Hooded Vulture is certainly vulnerable to the same threats faced by other vultures, especially contamination of its food supply, negative interactions with humans and human infrastructure, and demand for its use in the traditional health industry. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Poisoning is a confirmed threat in the region (Verdoorn 1997b, Snyman 2004, Botha 2007), backed up by further such incidents elsewhere in southern Africa (Mundy 1980, Mundy et al. 1992, Hancock 2009, Bradley and Maude 2014). A frightening recent development in southern Africa is the mass poisoning of vultures in the large protected area strongholds in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to help conceal poaching activities, although the traditional health industry has also been implicated in at least some of these instances (Hancock 2009, Groom et al. 2013, Bradley and Maude 2014). It is likely that in some cases of poisoning, White-backed Vultures G. africanus may be the primary targets. In two cases, the poisons used were an organophosphate and carbofuran respectively. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">White-headed Vultures, perhaps particularly young birds, likely wander widely and this means that birds originating from the region could easily succumb to such incidents in the neighbouring states. Research on the traditional health trade in South Africa confirms the demand for this species from that quarter (Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Several conservation NGOs active in vulture conservation including the Bird of Prey and Wildlife and Energy programmes of the Endangered Wildlife Trust, VulPro and the IUCN Vulture Specialist Group have undertaken conservation work related to this species. In the region, however, the species is restricted to formally protected areas and the future survival of the Hooded Vulture, as with the White-headed Vulture, in these areas is apparently wholly reliant on the security and appropriate management of these reserves.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A detailed assessment of the use of vultures, including this species, in traditional medicine in South Africa has recently been undertaken (Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013). Hooded Vultures possibly benefit from supplementary feeding sites (‘vulture restaurants') in the same way as other species (Butchart 1988, Piper 2004a,b) although their restriction to conservation areas may render these initiatives less relevant for this vulture species in the region.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The key conservation measures required are similar to those needed for other vulture species in the region but, like in the case of the White-headed Vulture, have somewhat limited applicability given the essential restriction of the species to formally protected areas. One danger is that conservation research and management actions in these reserves typically do not take bird species into account, despite the importance of these localities to bird conservation, which can result in a lack of the appropriate conservation focus on key bird species such as the Hooded Vulture. Conservation efforts targeted primarily at the more abundant and widespread Cape and White-backed vultures would likely also benefit the rarer Hooded Vulture. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Poisoning incidents need to be drastically reduced through rigorous investigation and prosecution of all such instances, as well as the maintenance of ongoing and high-profile education and publicity campaigns emphasising the causes and negative consequences of such incidents. The legal penalties need to be severe enough to act as material deterrents. The recent trend of the mass poisoning of vultures in conservation areas to mask poaching activities and for the traditional health industry requires particular ameliorative action. A move to lead-free ammunition should be considered where relevant. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Pertinent to the use of Hooded Vultures in the traditional health industry, an intervention strategy is required that addresses the following primary areas of action: a) reduce consumption/demand for vultures through an awareness-building campaign targeting public consumers and current roleplayers; b) change/create policy to improve regulation of the vulture trade; c) improve policing and enforcement for better regulation of the trade; d) improve understanding of the trade to allow more focused interventions, including more research and monitoring (Mander et al. 2007 McKean et al. 2013). Firm steps must be maintained to confirm that the food provided at supplementary feeding sites is free from any toxins harmful to the birds.</p>

</div>

<div id="_idContainer136" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of White-backed Vulture Gyps africanus satisfies criterion A4 (a population size reduction of 80%, projected or suspected to be met within a three generation period including the past and future, based on actual or potential levels of exploitation). A recent apparent escalation of large-scale poisoning incidents throughout the broader southern African range of the species, motivated by the masking of poaching operations and harvesting for the traditional health industry are the main drivers in this regard as are interactions with power-lines.</p>
	<h2>Reasons for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-backed Vulture was first considered formally threatened in the region in the third regional Red Data Book, where it was categorised as Vulnerable (Barnes 2000a). The species is listed as globally Critically Endangered. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species has in the past been considered conspecific with the Asian White-rumped Vulture G. bengalensis (Mundy et al. 1992). Recognition of the genus Pseudogyps relevant to the White-backed Vulture is apparently not supported by molecular genetic (nuclear and mitochondrial) investigations (Seibold and Helbig 1995, Johnson et al. 2006, Arshad et al. 2009). Mundy (2002), however, provides a compelling counter-argument to this position emphasising the utility of recognising Pseudogyps. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">90-100 cm, 4.6-6.6 kg. Sexes alike. Head dark grey with whitish down. Neck dark blue-grey, with sparser down. Compact ruff at base of neck white. Crop patch brown. Contour feathers brown to off-white, and sometimes streaked. Diagnostic white lower back and rump visible when wings spread. Tail blackish brown. Upperwing coverts and remiges dark; underwing coverts buffy white. Bill and cere dark grey to black. Eyes dark brown. Legs and feet blackish grey. Immatures attain adult plumage over a period of six years. Juveniles are generally darker than adults, with thick woolly down on yellowish green head and neck, streaked body plumage and back spotted brown (instead of white). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is readily confused with the Cape Vulture G. coprotheres, especially when seen in flight and over distance. Seen close-up, the adult is easily differentiated from the adult Cape Vulture by its smaller size, dark eye, and black colour to the exposed skin on the head, neck and breast patches. Seen in flight from below, the adult has all-black remiges that contrast strongly with the pale underwing coverts. This species usually lacks the line of distinct dark spots along the greater upperwing, and along both the greater underwing and greater under primary coverts often present in the Cape Vulture. In flight, adult White-backed Vultures also often show a white rump when viewed from above. The more streaked juvenile and immature White-backed Vultures differ primarily from young Cape Vultures in the black colour of the exposed skin of the head, neck and breast patches, which are reddish in juveniles and immatures of the latter species. In flight, young White-backed Vultures typically show striking pale lines in the underwing coverts that are absent in young Cape Vultures (Mundy et al. 1992, Allan 2000a, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Piper 2005c).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-backed Vulture is widespread in Africa south of the Sahel zone, with the exception of heavily forested equatorial regions in West and Central Africa (BirdLife International 2014l). Within the region it occurs in the northern parts of South Africa and in eastern Swaziland (Mundy 1997c). In South Africa, it is only absent from two of the nine provinces, i.e. Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, and from Lesotho. There is no evidence from the historical record that it ever bred in these three regions (Boshoff et al. 1983, Bonde 1993). It is now only a non-breeding visitor to Gauteng (Whittington-Jones 2004), although it bred there in historical times, e.g. at Hammans&#173;kraal and Zoutpan (Tarboton and Allan 1984). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Although the overall distribution as shown in SABAP1 was not considered to have changed significantly from earlier times, there was evidence for marked decreases in parts of the range (Tarboton and Allan 1984, Mundy 1997c). The overall distribution in the region also appears similar between SABAP1 and SABAP2. There is a suggestion of reduced abundance between the two atlasing periods, however, along the southern edge of the range in the Northern Cape and North West provinces (and possibly in the adjacent Free State), except in the Kimberley area where the population seems more isolated in SABAP2 compared with SABAP1. By contrast, SABAP2 shows records from further west in KwaZulu-Natal than did SABAP1.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The total southern Africa population was estimated at 15 000 pairs or 40 000 individuals in the mid-1990s and the global population at 270 000 mature individuals in the early 1990s (Mundy et al. 1992). These estimates, now approaching or over 20 years old, require updating.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In the region covered by the former Transvaal province of South Africa, the White-backed Vulture's breeding population in the late 1970s was estimated at 2 500 breeding pairs, of which 1 404 were in the Kruger National Park, 246 were in the Adjacent Private Nature Reserves, 630 were in the western Limpopo basin and 220 were in other regions of that erstwhile province (Tarboton and Allan 1984). Herholdt et al. (1997) estimated the Kruger National Park population at 600-1 000 pairs in the mid-1990s. Recent (2011) estimates for the Kruger National Park population are 624 pairs (Monadjem et al. 2013) and 904 (95% CI ±162) pairs (Murn et al. 2013), although both estimates apparently derive from the same dataset. Of these two estimates, the latter is likely the more applicable as it derives from a study specifically aimed at estimating population sizes. Murn et al. (2013) suggested that the population in the Kruger National Park may have decreased by as much as 50% since the late 1970s, mainly due to poisoning, although the difference between the late 1970s estimate and their estimate is 36%. An even more recent (2012) count of the area corresponding with Tarboton and Allan's (1984) ‘western Limpopo basin' region suggested a population of 610 pairs (480 active, and 130 inactive, nests), a figure remarkably similar to the earlier count. The breeding population in North West, now encompassing the south-western portion of the former Transvaal, allegedly may have been ‘well over 500 pairs' in the late 1990s (Verdoorn 1997b, 2004). Specific breeding localities mentioned include Wolmaransstad, Christiana, Bloemhof, Klerksdorp, Zeerust, Mmabatho, Mafikeng, Vryburg, Stella, Madikwe and Molopo, with at least 100 pairs in the last-mentioned region, but exact details are lacking.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In Free State province, the species has been recorded breeding since the mid-1980s at 12 localities, all in Kalahari Thornveld areas in the north-east of the province, and the population in the late 1990s ‘may be over 100 pairs' (Colahan and Esterhuizen 1997). A similar number was estimated in 2001, although it was believed that the population in the Sandveld Nature Reserve had decreased (Colahan 2004).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In Northern Cape Province, the population in the late 1990s was estimated at a maximum of 300 pairs (Anderson and Maritz 1997) but this was subsequently revised to at least 500 pairs (Anderson 2004). Breeding occurs at four main nodes: the greater Kimberley area, Askam (c. 100 pairs), the South African portion of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, and Breipal near Vanzylsrus. The greater Kimberley population was thought to number c. 107 pairs in the late 1990s (Anderson and Maritz 1997) but in 2001 this population was counted in greater detail and 244 breeding pairs were located at six different localities: Dronfield 43 pairs; Riet River 69 pairs; Rivermead 24 pairs; Susanna 79 pairs; Paardeberg 27 pairs; and Secretarius 2 pairs (Murn et al. 2002). Of these six localities, the Susanna colony occurs in the Free State Province and the Dronfield colony straddles both the Northern Cape and Free State provinces. The Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park population was estimated at c. 60 pairs in the late 1990s but earlier work during 1988-1990, however, stated that only a maximum of 25 breeding pairs was found in this protected area and that there was evidence of population reduction related to poisoning on neighbouring commercial farms (Herholdt and Anderson 2006). The Breipal population near Vanzylsrus was established in 1999, numbered c. 100 pairs in 2003 and apparently over 200 pairs in 2008 (Anderson and Maritz 1997, Anderson 2004, Maritz 2008).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In KwaZulu-Natal, 103 and 106 occupied nests were counted in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in 1972 and 1973 respectively (Hitchins 1980). In 1984, 242 occupied nests were counted in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park and the increase was ascribed to immigration related to the loss of suitable nesting sites outside the protected area (Whateley 1986). One estimate of the total KwaZulu-Natal population in the late 1990s was 350 pairs (Piper and Johnson 1997). Another covering the same period, however, estimated the population in the KwaZulu-Natal ‘Important Bird Areas' at 480-545 pairs (Ndumo 50-60 pairs, Itala 10-15 pairs, Mkuze 200 pairs, HIP 200-250 pairs; (Johnson et al. 1998). Unfortunately, this estimate provided no supporting details and assumed that breeding occurred at several localities which subsequent investigations showed to be incorrect, e.g. Ndumo, Ithala and ‘St Lucia' (Rushworth et al. 2007, Howells et al. 2011) An estimate for 2004 was 300-350 pairs in KwaZulu-Natal, with 150-250 pairs in protected areas, and the population was believed to be decreasing (Rushworth and Piper 2004). In 2007 and based on aerial surveys, the KZN population was estimated at 344 pairs, 275 in HIP, 35 in Mkuze Game Reserve and 34 in Pongolo Nature Reserve (McKean et al. 2013). During a 2011 aerial survey, 418 occupied nests were counted in HIP (Howells et al. 2011). The 2011 aerial survey also covered the other main breeding localities of this species in Zululand and counted 14 pairs at Mkuze Game Reserve, which has decreased further to 8 pairs in 2013, 22 at Pongolo Nature Reserve, 41 at Pongola Private Game Reserve, 32 at Thula Thula Private Nature Reserve and eight at Magudu South. This provided at total of 535 pairs in Zululand, i.e. essentially the province as a whole, of which 78% are in HIP.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In Swaziland, the breeding population was estimated at about 200 pairs in the early 1990s (Parker 1994, 1997a). In 2001, Monadjem (2003) estimated the population at 163 pairs but subsequently considered this to have been an underestimate in the light of a comprehensive count of 240 active nests in 2002. These were located almost exclusively in protected areas, mainly at Hlane-Mlawula-Mbuluzi but also at Mkhaya-Big Bend and the IYSIS Cattle Ranch (Monadjem and Garcelon 2005). The species was believed to be increasing in Swaziland in 2003 (Monadjem et al. 2003).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Uneven coverage and the outdated nature of some estimates make an accurate current estimate of the total breeding population for the region uncertain. The best estimate would be about 3 675 breeding pairs (i.e. 7 350 mature individuals), i.e. Kruger National Park 904, remainder of region covered by former Transvaal 1 096, North West (excluding area previously in former Transvaal) 300, Free State 100, Northern Cape 500, Swaziland 240 and KwaZulu-Natal 535. This is similar in total to the 3 500 pairs estimated by Anderson (2000d). It differs substantially in detail though, i.e. with fewer pairs estimated for the Kruger National Park and more pairs for Northern Cape, Swaziland and KwaZulu-Natal. </p>
	<h2>Trend justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Tarboton and Allan (1984) considered that ancestrally the White-backed Vulture was ‘undoubtedly more abundant and widely distributed' in the former Transvaal Province than it was in the late 1970s. They provide several examples of known breeding localities abandoned in the period from the beginning of the last century until the early 1970s, although they also cite two examples of new, albeit small, colonies established in the late 1970s, one linked to game farming, and the other to the establishment of a protected area. In the Satara region of Kruger National Park, 64-68 pairs were counted in 1967-68 (Kemp and Kemp 1975) but in 1979 only 33-44 pairs were found in the same area (Tarboton and Allan 1984). This represents a decrease of 33-50%, which was attributed to a prolonged drought prior to the earlier counts. As discussed above, the latest information from Kruger National Park suggests a possible 36% decrease in breeding pairs between the late 1970s and 2011 (Murn et al. 2013). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-backed Vulture also seems ancestrally to have been more widespread in Free State and Northern Cape provinces, and in Swaziland. In Free State, it may be continuing to decrease but specific details are lacking (Colahan and Esterhuizen 1997, Colahan 2004). In Northern Cape, it is believed to be increasing overall, with a new colony having established near Vanzylsrus and the greater Kimberley population expanding, although evidence of local (but possibly only temporary) decreases have been observed in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (Anderson and Maritz 1997, Murn et al. 2002, Anderson 2004, Herholdt and Anderson 2006). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In KwaZulu-Natal there would appear to have been a startling increase in breeding pairs at HIP, the primary stronghold of the species in that province (Hitchins 1980, Whateley 1986, Howells et al. 2011). As also mentioned above, the SABAP2 (2007 to date) data suggest a western expansion in range in KwaZulu-Natal when compared with the SABAP1 (1981-1991) distribution. The Mkuze breeding population, however, was known to have decreased from 34 pairs in 2004 to eight pairs in 2009 in the face of several poisoning incidents, subsequently increasing marginally to 14 pairs in 2011 (Howells et al. 2011). In Swaziland, the numbers of breeding birds may have increased locally in recent times, e.g. the species did not breed at Mkhaya Game Reserve in the mid-1980s but 10-15 pairs nested there by the mid- to late-1990s (Monadjem et al. 2003).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The most parsimonious conclusion based on the available information would suggest that overall the White-backed Vulture population in the region has remained largely stable since about the 1970s, until the recent apparently large-scale decreases in the Kruger National Park and in the network of reserves in KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-backed Vulture inhabits the woodland regions of southern Africa (Mundy et al. 1992, Mundy 1997c). Its feeding and foraging habits are similar to those of the congeneric Cape Vulture and it relies primarily on large mammalian carcasses and feeds communally (Piper 2005c). It is reported to very occasionally take live prey, e.g. young Springbok Antidorcas marsupialis and Warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus (Mundy et al. 1992). This vulture is capable of long-distance movements, as evidenced by ring recoveries (Oatley 1998), re-sightings of marked birds (Monadjem et al. 2013) and GPS-GSM tracked birds (Phipps et al. 2013) but is not migratory (Mundy 1997c, Piper 2005c). Movements can be on a sub-continental scale and GPS-GSM tracked immatures made daily movements up to about 200 km (Phipps et al. 2013). White-backed Vultures typically roost in trees and on pylons (Mundy et al. 1992). Like the Cape Vulture, the White-backed Vulture drinks and bathes regularly (Mundy et al. 1992).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The breeding biology of the White-backed Vulture is fairly well known (Kemp and Kemp 1975, Mundy et al. 1992, Monadjem 2001, Monadjem et al. 2003, Herholdt and Anderson 2006, Tarboton 2011). The age of first breeding is four years, although birds only acquire full adult plumage in their 7th year. The species is monogamous. Unlike most other Gyps species, White-backed Vultures typically nest in tall trees and not on cliffs. Nesting on steel pylons has been recorded regularly in the Kimberley area (Northern Cape), Vryburg (North West), Marble Hall (Limpopo) and Boshof (Free State) (Ledger and Hobbs 1985, Wilson 2006, Anderson and Hohne 2008, de Swardt 2013). Nesting is typically loosely colonial, with pairs breeding within sight of one another, but usually with only one or sometimes two nests in a single tree. Where available, nests are typically concentrated in tall trees along watercourses (Bamford et al. 2009c). Nests are built of sticks and usually lined with grass. They are often re-used. The egg-laying period spans April-September, mainly April-July. The clutch almost invariably comprises a single egg, only very rarely are two eggs are recorded. Juveniles are partially dependent on their parents for food for 5-6 months after fledging. Breeding success is 43-87%. Nesting success is negatively correlated with nest density (Bamford et al. 2009c). The species is single brooded. Natural causes of breeding failure include predation of nestlings by Leopard Panthera pardus, Serval Felis serval and Honey Badger Mellivora capensis.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Annual survival in one South African study was found to be at least 85% in second-year birds to just less than 100% in adults, although the sample size (n=7) was small for the latter and overall the study was compromised by the fading of patagial tags after about 4-5 years (Monadjem et al. 2013). Natural sources of mortality include birds killed by Lion Panthera leo at carcasses and by Black-backed Jackals Canis mesomelas while drinking and bathing (Piper 2005c, Herholdt and Anderson 2006).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threats to the White-backed Vulture are similar to those faced by the other large vulture species in the region and appear to stem at core from contamination (and at least sometimes perhaps shortage) of their food supply, negative interactions with human infrastructure, and demand for vultures for use in the traditional health industry. Threats reducing adult survival, as is the case relevant to many of the dangers discussed below, are of particular concern, as the population stability of this species, which evidences a naturally low reproductive rate, likely depends on high adult survival rates.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Poisoning as a major threat to this species has been exhaustively documented (van Jaarsveld 1986, Mundy et al. 1992, Anderson 1995, Herholdt and Anderson 2006, Botha 2007, Naidoo et al. 2011). This poisoning may be deliberate, e.g. when aimed at harvesting birds for the traditional health industry, or accidental, e.g. when targeting mammalian carnivores. A frightening recent development in southern Africa is the mass poisoning of vultures, primarily of this species, in the large protected area strongholds in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to help cover poaching activities, although the traditional health industry has also been implicated in at least some of these instances (Hancock 2009, Groom et al. 2013, Bradley and Maude 2014). The wide ranging nature of White-backed Vultures means that birds originating from the region could easily succumb to such incidents in the neighbouring states. Unconfirmed low levels of poisoning, likely with organophosphates, are suspected in many birds taken to animal rehabilitation centres (Naidoo et al. 2011). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, a major potential threat to Gyps vultures, is not currently known to be widely used for veterinary purposes in the region, nor is it licensed for such use, but this drug has been confirmed to be toxic to this species (Green et al. 2004, Pain et al. 2008). Ketoprofen, another widely available NSAID, is also toxic to this vulture (Naidoo et al. 2009).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This vulture is a frequent victim of electrocution on smaller pylons (Anderson and Kruger 1995, van Rooyen 2000, Kruger et al. 2004). It also succumbs to collisions while in flight with overhead transmission lines (Anderson 2000c, van Rooyen 2000, Naidoo et al. 2011). Such collisions are likely a major cause of injuries and affects 42% of birds presented at rehabilitation centres, as evidenced by soft tissue and skeletal damage (Naidoo et al. 2011).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">White-backed Vultures are highly sought-after in the traditional medicine trade and this comprises a further major threat to the species with many birds killed using poisons and other means of hunting to satisfy this demand (Mander et al. 2007, Bamford et al. 2009a, McKean et al. 2013). Bush encroachment is a threat that may render woodlands too dense for the birds to either easily see or access carcasses but to a lesser degree than the Cape Vulture (Bamford et al. 2009b). This vulture is also sensitive to disturbance, especially when breeding, and this typically restricts nesting to protected, or at least sparsely populated, regions.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species occasionally drowns in circular concrete farm reservoirs particularly in the drier western parts of the region (Knight 1987, Anderson 1995, Anderson et al. 1997, 1999, Herholdt and Anderson 2006) but apparently not to the same extent as the Cape Vulture. It has been suggested that poisoned vultures may be particularly prone to such drowning, as one symptom of the poisoning may be extreme thirst, and this potential association should be investigated.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">White-backed Vultures are also sometimes killed in collisions with motor vehicles (Anderson 2000c), particularly where carcasses occur on or close to roads. The vulture is also known to have collided with aircraft in flight. White-backed Vultures are occasionally vulnerable to being caught in gin traps (Anderson 2000c). Osteodystrophy, as has been claimed for the Cape Vulture, has also been claimed for this species (Verdoorn et al. 1997, Naidoo et al. 2011) but requires confirmation.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The long-distance movements evidenced by this species (Oatley 1998, Monadjem et al. 2013, Phipps et al. 2013), perhaps especially juveniles and immatures, which are truly sub-continental in scale, mean that individuals are exposed to a wide range of threats during the course of their wanderings. Even birds present in large protected areas move outside these regions and hence within range of the many major dangers faced by the species. A simple example is of a bird ringed in a private nature reserve near Kimberley in Northern Cape and recovered poisoned in Namibia (Bridgeford 2001). The White-backed Vulture, like the Cape Vulture, benefits from a communal foraging system and any large-scale reduction in numbers could negatively impact the efficiency of this method of carcass location, with further negative consequences for the species (Dermody et al. 2011).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Vulture Study Group was established in 1977 with a mainly southern Africa focus (Mundy et al. 1992). This group is now essentially subsumed into the broader Bird of Prey Programme of the Endangered Wildlife Trust. The Endangered Wildlife Trust's current vulture research and conservation activities largely operate under the umbrella of the SASOL Vulture Monitoring Project. The Wildlife and Energy Programme of the Endangered Wildlife Trust is targeted at minimising the risk to wildlife posed by energy and communications infrastructure, including the dangers to large birds such as vultures stemming from electrocution by, and collisions with, such infrastructure (van Rooyen and Piper 1997, Jenkins et al. 2010). The Wildlife and Energy Programme's largest project is to administer a strategic partnership, formed in 1996, between the Endangered Wildlife Trust and Eskom, South Africa's national electricity provider. The Wildlife and Energy Partnership maintains a ‘Central Incident Register' of all bird mortality incidents related to electrical infrastructure, including those involving vultures. VulPro based in North West province is active in the rehabilitation of vultures. A recently established global organisation specifically relevant to vulture conservation is the IUCN Vulture Specialist Group formed in 2011. Vulture News, a journal dedicated to publishing information on vulture research and conservation efforts and which was initiated in 1979 by the Vulture Study Group, is now the journal of the IUCN Vulture Specialist Group. The International Vulture Awareness Day, the first Saturday in September every year, aims to increase conservation awareness. Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife initiated annual Vulture Count Days on International Vulture Awareness Day from 2003.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Mundy (2000) suggested that successful vulture conservation measures, based on experience gained largely in South Africa, relied on three ‘simple' approaches: 1) active conservationists working directly with land-owners to educate the latter as to the threats faced by these birds; 2) the need for up-to-date research and monitoring information to inform conservation action; and 3) that approaches based on cooperation and partnership were more productive than those based on confrontation. Verdoorn et al. (1997) provides an overview of the strategy aimed at engendering a positive attitude amongst farming communities relevant to vultures. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A vulture conservation strategy for KwaZulu-Natal covering the 5-year period 2008-2012 was produced. An increase in game farming on commercial ranch-lands within the range of the species is likely to the advantage of this species (Murn and Anderson 2008). Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife has implemented a formal monitoring plan for this species in the province of KwaZulu-Natal to determine population trends and breeding success as well as to determine age specific mortality rates. A Zululand Vulture Group has been established to co-ordinate vulture conservation interventions within the Zululand region of KwaZulu-Natal. It is comprised of representatives from Non-Governmental Organisations, private land-owners and Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">An example of mitigation relevant to electrocution by pylons is the modification of these structures to reduce this risk (Northern Cape Raptor Conservation Forum 2006). Collisions can be mitigated for by line-marking and judicious routing of lines, although the value of the former remains largely untested and may be inherently limited in its effectiveness related to the biological attributes of flying vultures (Jenkins et al. 2010, Martin 2011, Martin et al. 2012). A detailed assessment of the use of vultures in traditional medicine in South Africa has recently been undertaken (Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013). The danger posed by drowning in circular farm reservoirs is relatively easily ameliorated by placing objects such as logs into such structures, carefully regulating their water-levels, completely covering them or providing alternative, more suitable, drinking structures to avoid these incidents (Anderson et al. 1997, 1999). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Supplementary feeding (‘vulture restaurants') is a widely implemented vulture conservation measure both in the region and elsewhere in the world (Butchart 1988, Brown 1990, van Rooyen and Vernon 1997, Anderson and Anthony 2006, Monadjem et al. 2012, Phipps et al. 2013). The primary potential value of these schemes is to address any food shortages and to provide uncontaminated food. Supplementary feeding may be particularly valuable in increasing the survival of juvenile vultures (Piper et al. 1999). A guide to the establishment and operation of supplementary feeding sites is available (Boshoff et al. 2011a). A vulture restaurant monitoring protocol document also exists (Wolter et al. undated). A register of vulture restaurants is maintained by VulPro and is updated on a regular basis with the use of tracking data identifying new feeding sites followed by site visits to confirm. There are apparently some 124 currently active feeding sites in southern Africa (Wolter 2012). These feeding sites are often accompanied by hides that allow close-up viewing of the feeding vultures; direct exposure that helps engender appreciation of these birds.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The rescue, rehabilitation and release by recognised rehabilitation facilities of White-backed Vultures temporarily incapacitated by the various threats faced by the species is an increasingly important conservation measure (Verrynne 1997, Naidoo et al. 2011). It should be noted, however, that only 26% of White-backed Vultures entering such facilities are subsequently released. Key facilities recently involved in such rehabilitation work include VulPro (North West), and the African Bird of Prey Sanctuary (KwaZulu-Natal).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The key conservation measures required focus primarily on the major threats stemming from poisoning, energy-related infrastructure, the traditional health industry, potential food shortages, drowning and negative perceptions and ignorance. The scourge of poisoning needs to be combatted by the rigorous investigation and prosecution of all such instances, as well as the maintenance of ongoing and high-profile education and publicity campaigns emphasising the causes and negative consequences of such incidents. The legal penalties need to be severe enough to act as material deterrents. The recent trend of the mass poisoning of vultures in conservation areas to mask poaching activities and for the traditional health industry requires particular ameliorative action. A move to lead-free ammunition should be considered where relevant. Careful monitoring of the potential use of diclofenac, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs lethal to Gyps vultures, is required. Meloxicam has been shown to be non-toxic to Gyps vultures and exists as an alternative NSAID (Naidoo et al. 2008). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Additional effort is required to reduce electrocutions and collisions of White-backed Vultures related to power-line infrastructure. Existing pylons and overhead lines need to be replaced or retro-fitted, on a carefully prioritised basis, and new infrastructure needs to designed and routed, to minimise the risks from electrocution and collisions. All known structures causing fatalities should be replaced immediately and all lines causing collisions should be mitigated without further delay. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Relevant to the use of White-backed Vultures in the traditional health industry, an intervention strategy is required that addresses the following primary areas of action: a) reduce consumption/demand for vultures through an awareness-building campaign targeting public consumers and current roleplayers; b) change/create policy to improve regulation of the vulture trade; c) improve policing and enforcement for better regulation of the trade; d) improve understanding of the trade to allow more focused interventions, including more research and monitoring (Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013). McKean and Rushworth (2008) provide supplementary guidelines for interventions aimed at addressing the threat to vultures from traditional use. Firm steps must be maintained to confirm that the food provided at supplementary feeding sites is free from any toxins harmful to the birds. The relevant stakeholders need to be continually reminded of the threat to White-backed Vultures posed by drowning the farm reservoirs. Similar ongoing action is required to control the dangers from human disturbance at breeding colonies on private land. </p>

	<h3>Research priorities and questions</h3>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;Regular and accurate censuses of the number of breeding pairs of White-backed Vultures throughout their regional range are a high priority in order to monitor the population size and stability on an ongoing basis. This is best achieved using aerial censuses using fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters (Murn et al. 2002, Monadjem and Garcelon 2005, Howells et al. 2011, Murn et al. 2013). Such counts are already being undertaken on an annual basis in the KwaZulu-Natal protected areas where this species occurs (Howells et al. 2011).</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;Satellite and GSM tracking of adults, immatures and juveniles is invaluable in determining movements and mortality factors (Wolter 2006, Bartels et al. 2007, Phipps et al. 2013). Ringing and patagial tagging (Botha 2007, Monadjem et al. 2012) can also provide information on movements and mortality but is likely less cost effective in this regard.</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;More research is required on the ongoing impact of electrical infrastructure on White-backed Vulture populations in terms of electrocutions and collisions, and on the efficacy of mitigation measures.</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;Foraging patterns and food supply, coupled with the actual and potential value of supplementary feeding schemes, are worthy of deeper investigation linked to tracking studies.</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;Ongoing research is required relevant to the exploitation of this species in the traditional health industry (Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013).</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;The issue of potential lead poisoning through bullets, and fragments of bullets, lodged in carcasses available to White-backed Vultures, especially at supplementary feeding sites, requires urgent investigation.</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;Further investigation of the potential toxicity of additional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other pharmaceutical drugs used in the veterinary industry, is necessary.</p>

	<p class="Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US">White-headed Vulture</p>
	<p class="Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Aegypius occipitalis</p>
</div>

<div id="_idContainer149" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of White-headed Vulture Aegypius occipitalis is estimated to number less than250 mature individuals with an estimated continuing decline of at least 25% within one generation, satisfying the criterion C1 for regionally Critically Endangered. A recent apparent escalation of large-scale poisoning incidents throughout the broader southern African range of the species, motivated by the masking of poaching operations is the main driver.</p>
	<h2>Reasons for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The formally threatened status of this vulture in the region dates to the second South African Red Data Book which categorised it as merely ‘Rare' (Brooke 1984), a ranking roughly similar to Near Threatened in the current IUCN categorisations. In the third regional Red Data Book this was upgraded to Vulnerable (Barnes 2000a). This vulture was first considered globally threatened in 2007 when it was categorised as globally Vulnerable, recently being uplisted to Critically Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-headed Vulture is monotypic. Suggestions have been made that the genus Trigonoceps should be merged with Aegypius. This suggestion dates back at least to White (1951), followed by Amadon (1977), Stresemann and Amadon (1979) and Amadon et al. (1988), and is ostensibly supported by molecular genetic (nuclear and mitochondrial) investigations (Wink and Sauer-Gürth 2000, 2004). </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">85 cm, 3.3-5.3 kg. Sexes exhibit sexual dimorphism in plumage. Head covered in woolly white down. Bare facial skin pink. Large ruff black on hindneck, white on foreneck. Back, scapulars, rump and uppertail coverts blackish, with buff feather edges. Median upperwing coverts fringed off-white. Below with white crop patch, black breast and white belly and ‘leggings'. Underwing dark except for white axillaries and a characteristic thin white line between the underwing coverts and the remiges that characterises this species (although this feature is barely discernable in younger birds); females also show a pale silvery to white wash on the secondaries (Mundy 1985). When seen in flight and at a distance, however, care must be taken not to confuse this species with the similarly dark Lappet-faced Vulture Torgos tracheliotos and Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus (Mundy et al. 1992, Allan 2000a, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The juveniles and immatures of these three species are particularly prone to being confused. Murn (2012) describes a method of individually recognising White-headed Vultures using the pattern in their median wing coverts.</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-headed Vulture is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa with a local population on the Dahlak Archipelago in the Red Sea off Eritrea. Within the region, it occurs in the northern regions of South Africa and in eastern Swaziland (Mundy 1997d) with its distribution known to be much reduced from earlier times (Tarboton and Allan 1984, Anderson and Maritz 1997, Mundy 1997d, Monadjem et al. 2003, Monadjem and Garcelon 2005). The SABAP2 map suggests that the species is now largely confined to the conservation areas of the Lowveld of Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces, and similarly protected areas in the Zululand region of KwaZulu-Natal and the Swaziland Lowveld. Records from other areas are now pitifully few with records in the Northern Cape and North West provinces along the Botswana border. Particularly striking is the paucity of SABAP2 records from the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in Northern Cape Province, and the complete absence of SABAP2 records from north-west Limpopo Province, compared with SABAP1. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the White-headed Vulture is estimated at 7 000-12 500 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014m). In the region covered by the former Transvaal province of South Africa, the White-headed Vulture, in the late 1970s, was restricted as a breeding species to the eastern Lowveld conservation areas, where the population was estimated at c. 105 pairs (Tarboton and Allan 1984). The vast majority of breeding pairs (92 pairs; 88%) was estimated to occur in the Kruger National Park. Benson (1997) considered this estimate too high and suggested a total population in the eastern Lowveld conservation areas of less than50 pairs. During annual surveys covering the period 1982-1993 up to 30 breeding pairs (in 1993) were recorded in the Kruger National Park (Herholdt et al. 1997) with a more recent (2011) estimate for the Kruger National Park providing 60 pairs (95% CI ±13) (Murn et al. 2013).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In KwaZulu-Natal, nine breeding pairs occurred in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in 1972 and 1973 respectively (Hitchins 1980). This number had apparently remained constant since 1970 and some of these pairs were known as early as 1962. A total of eight pairs were present in 1989 (Howells et al. 2011). The total KwaZulu-Natal population was estimated at 15 pairs in the mid-1990s (Piper and Johnson 1997) and 12-15 pairs (all in protected areas) in 2004 (Rushworth and Piper 2004). The population was believed to be decreasing in the mid-2000s (Rushworth and Piper 2004). In 2007, the KZN population was estimated at six pairs, five in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park and one in Pongolo Nature Reserve (McKean et al. 2013). In 2011, four pairs were counted in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, one pair in Pongolo Nature Reserve and one pair in Magudu South private game reserve (Howells et al. 2011). In 2013, five pairs were counted in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, one pair in Pongolo Nature Reserve and one pair in Magudu South Private Game Reserve (Howells et al. 2013). A single pair was believed present at Mkuze Game Reserve but this pair failed to breed successfully in the period 2003-2011. A pair was however recorded incubating during July 2014. In 2010, an additional pair was located on a privately owned nature reserve south of Pongolo Nature Reserve but this site was not active in 2011 as well as in 2013.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Swaziland population was estimated at about six pairs in the mid-1990s, with breeding recorded from Hlane Royal National Park, Mlawula Nature Reserve and Mkhaya Game Reserve in the northern Lowveld, and suspected from Lavumisa in the southern Lowveld (Parker 1994, 1997b). In the early 2000s, there were five known pairs in the country: four in Hlane and one in Mlawula, with the single previously known pair at Mkhaya having abandoned the site sometime in the 1990s (Monadjem et al. 2003, Monadjem 2004a, b, Monadjem and Garcelon 2005). The nests of all five of these pairs disappeared over a five year period and no nests of this species have been located since the late 2000s (A Monadjem unpubl. data).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Based on the information presented above, the total regional population of the White-headed Vulture in the region would appear to be c. 77 breeding pairs (i.e. 158 mature individuals), with 60 pairs in Kruger National Park and eight pairs in the Adjacent Private Nature Reserves (based on Tarboton and Allan's 1984 estimate of the proportion of pairs outside the Kruger National Park) and nine pairs in KwaZulu-Natal. This is at the lower edge of the estimate of 80-120 pair presented in the previous red data book for the region (Anderson 2000d). Confidence in this regional population estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Trend justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has shown severe declines throughout its West African range (Thiollay 2006, 2007) and also across southern Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001), thus its global population is estimated to be declining at a slow to moderate rate (BirdLife International 2014m). The White-headed Vulture has apparently disappeared entirely as a breeding species over parts of the region since historical times, e.g. most of the area covered by the former Transvaal, the Swaziland Lowveld and possibly parts of Northern Cape, although this has not been as well documented as it has been in the case of the Lappet-faced Vulture. As with that species, this large-scale historical reduction seems to have stabilised in modern times and the breeding range appears to have remained largely unchanged since the 1970s at least (Monadjem 2004b). Its remaining primary stronghold is the Kruger National Park and Adjacent Private Nature Reserves, with only remnant breeding populations elsewhere in the region in Zululand in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Everywhere, and somewhat in contrast to the Lappet-faced Vulture, its presence as a breeding bird is entirely restricted to protected areas. Unlike its larger relative, it shows no evidence for any local increases anywhere in its regional range and indeed may be further decreasing in KwaZulu-Natal. Confidence in the regional population trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The breeding biology of the White-headed Vulture is fairly well known (Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005d, Tarboton 2011). The age of first breeding is probably at least six years. At Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, 17-61% (35%) of pairs failed to breed in any given year. The species is monogamous. It is believed to be territorial and nests are typically solitary and spaced well apart, i.e. typically 11-29 km apart in suitable habitat but occasionally as close as 1-2 km (Howells and Hustler 1984, Hustler and Howells 1988, Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005d, Tarboton 2011). Nests are situated in the crowns of trees, and are built of sticks and usually lined with grass. They are often re-used. The main egg-laying period spans June-July (May-October). The clutch comprises a single egg. Females may re-lay after early failure. Incubation is by both sexes and spans 55-56 days. The nestling period is 115 days. The post-fledging dependence period is up to a further five months. Breeding success is reported at about 44%. The species is single brooded. Natural causes of breeding failure include predation of nestlings by Verreauxs' Eagle Aquila verreauxii.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-headed Vulture is a species of woodland habitats (Mundy et al. 1992, Mundy 1997d). It sources its food through a combination of scavenging, kleptoparasitism and direct predation on small animals (Mundy et al. 1992, Millar 1995, Piper 2005d). This vulture, like the Lappet-faced Vulture, typically occurs in fairly small numbers, especially when compared with Gyps vultures, at large carcasses but is also regularly found at smaller carcasses and indeed may be more reliant on these for its regular food supply than the large carcasses which attract big numbers of Gyps vultures (Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005d). Adults are thought to be largely sedentary and juveniles and immatures to wander more widely (Mundy 1997d, Piper 2005d). Like other vultures, the White-headed Vulture drinks and bathes regularly (Mundy et al. 1992).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">That this species essentially disappeared unheralded from most of its breeding range outside large protected areas in the region means that knowledge of the dangers underpinning this decrease are extremely poorly documented. Its absence outside protected areas was particularly well documented by Herremans and Herremans-Tonnoeyr (2000) in Botswana. It is vulnerable to the same threats faced by other large vulture species: primarily contamination of its food supply, negative interactions with humans and human infrastructure, and demand for its use in the traditional health industry. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Poisoning is a confirmed threat in the region (Mundy et al. 1992, Herholdt et al. 1997, Verdoorn 1997b), backed up with incidents elsewhere in southern Africa (Mundy 1980, Mundy et al. 1992, Bridgeford 2001). In two extra-limital incidents, the poisons used were an organophosphate and carbofuran respectively. In one of these last two cases, the motivation appeared linked to harvesting for the muthi trade, although White-backed Vultures G. africanus may have been the primary target. Research on the traditional health trade in South Africa confirms the demand for this species (Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013). A frightening recent development in southern Africa is the mass poisoning of vultures in large protected areas in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to help cover poaching activities, although the traditional health industry has also been implicated in at least some of these instances (Hancock 2009, Groom et al. 2013, Bradley and Maude 2014). White-headed Vultures, particularly young birds, likely wander widely and this means that birds originating from the region could easily succumb to such incidents in the neighbouring states. </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species also falls under the ambit of the various conservation NGOs active in vulture conservation as detailed under the Cape and White-backed vulture accounts. These include the Bird of Prey and Wildlife and Energy programmes of the Endangered Wildlife Trust, VulPro and the IUCN Vulture Specialist Group. In the region, however, the species is restricted to formally protected areas and the future survival of the White-headed Vulture in these areas is apparently wholly reliant on the security and appropriate management of these properties.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A detailed assessment of the use of vultures, including this species, in traditional medicine in South Africa has recently been undertaken (Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013). White-headed Vultures visit and possibly benefit from supplementary feeding sites (‘vulture restaurants') in the same way as other vulture species (Butchart 1988, Piper 2004a,b), although their restriction to conservation areas may render these initiatives less relevant for this vulture in the region. Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife has implemented a formal monitoring plan for this species in the province of KwaZulu-Natal to determine population trends and breeding success as well as to determine age specific mortality rates. A Zululand Vulture Group has been established to co-ordinate vulture conservation interventions within the Zululand region of KwaZulu-Natal. It is comprised of representatives from Non-Governmental Organisations, private land-owners and Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The key conservation measures required are similar to those needed for other vulture species in the region but have somewhat limited applicability given the essential restriction of the species to formally protected areas. One danger is that conservation research and management actions in reserves typically do not take bird species into account, despite the importance of these localities to bird conservation, which can result in a lack of the appropriate conservation focus on key bird species. Conservation efforts targeted primarily at the more widespread Cape and White-backed vultures would likely also benefit the rarer White-headed Vulture. The scourge of poisoning needs to be combatted by the rigorous investigation and prosecution of all such instances, as well as the maintenance of ongoing and high-profile education and publicity campaigns. The legal penalties need to be severe enough to act as material deterrents. The recent trend of the mass poisoning of vultures in conservation areas to mask poaching activities and for the traditional health industry requires particular ameliorative action. A move to lead-free ammunition should be considered where relevant. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Pertinent to the use of White-headed Vultures in the traditional health industry, an intervention strategy is required that addresses the following primary areas of action: a) reduce consumption/demand for vultures through an awareness-building campaign targeting public consumers and current roleplayers; b) change/create policy to improve regulation of the vulture trade; c) improve policing and enforcement for better regulation of the trade; d) improve understanding of the trade to allow more focused interventions, including more research and monitoring (Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013). McKean and Rushworth (2008) provide supplementary guidelines for interventions aimed at addressing the threat to vultures from traditional use. Firm steps must be maintained to confirm that the food provided at supplementary feeding sites is free from any toxins harmful to the birds. </p>

	<h3>Research priorities and questions</h3>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US">Key priorities for future conservation research are briefly listed below and are similar to those for other vulture species in the region. </p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;Regular and accurate censuses of the number of breeding pairs of White-headed Vultures throughout their regional range are a high priority in order to monitor the population size and stability on an ongoing basis. This is likely best-achieved using aerial censuses using fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters (Monadjem and Garcelon 2005, Howells et al. 2011, Murn et al. 2013). Such counts are already being undertaken on an annual basis in the KwaZulu-Natal protected areas where this species occurs (Howells et al. 2011).</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;Satellite and GSM tracking of adults, immatures and juveniles can be invaluable in determining vulture movements and mortality factors (Phipps et al. 2013, Bradley and Maude 2014) and should be expanded to this species. Ringing and patagial tagging (Botha 2007, Monadjem et al. 2012) can also provide information on movements and mortality but is likely less cost effective in this regard.</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;The foraging habits and diet of this species remain worthy of deeper investigation and proper quantification. Detailed satellite-tracking studies and the employment of state-of-the-art technologies would be particularly relevant here.</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;Ongoing research is required relevant to the exploitation of this species in the traditional health industry (Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013).</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;The issue of potential lead poisoning through bullets, and fragments of bullets, lodged in carcasses available to White-headed Vultures, especially at supplementary feeding sites, requires urgent investigation.</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;The potential toxicity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to this species should be investigated. </p>

	<h2>JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross Thalassarche chlororhynchos is estimated to be undergoing a continuous decline of greater than 50% over a 71 year (three generation period), satisfying criterion A4 for classification as globally Endangered. In addition, the species has an AoO of less than500 km2 and breeds at less than5 locations (namely the islands of the Tristan da Cunha group in the Atlantic). The species occurs in large numbers in South African territorial waters. The global status of Endangered is also adopted as the regional status.</p>
	<h2>Reasons for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species does not breed at the Prince Edwards Islands but does occur in South African territorial waters on a regular basis in large numbers. The species is currently listed as globally Endangered and was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Yellow-nosed albatrosses (s.l.) breeding on Atlantic Ocean islands were long considered conspecific with populations from the Indian Ocean, with the present taxon considered to be the nominate race of the polytypic Yellow-nosed Albatross Thalassarche/Diomedea chlororhynchos (s.l.). The complex was split into two species, viz. Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross T. chlororhynchos (s.s.) and Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross T. carteri (including ‘bassi') based on their non-overlapping breeding ranges and consistent differences in plumage and morphology (Robertson and Nunn 1998). The Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross T. chlororhynchos is now considered monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">72-80 cm, 1.8-2.8 kg. Sexes alike. Head and neck are typically washed grey. Back and tail are blackish-brown contrasting with white rump and upper tail coverts. Upperwings are blackish-brown. Underwing is predominantly white with a broad black leading edge. Bill is predominantly black with a cherry-red tip and a yellow stripe on the top of the bill, which at close range is rounded in shape. Eyes are dark brown and legs are pale bluish pink. Bill of juvenile completely black (Ryan 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds at the islands of the Tristan da Cunha group, including Tristan, Gough, Nightingale, Inaccessible, Middle and Stoltenhoff islands (ACAP 2009b) dispersing widely across the south Atlantic and south-west Indian oceans (Tickell 2000). Distribution in the Indian Ocean is however little known due to confusion with Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross. Individuals have been recorded at Amsterdam Island (Roux and Martinez 1987), off the Australian mainland (Reid and Carter 1988) and the Chatham Islands (Robertson 1975). The species is a common non-breeding visitor to the shallow shelf waters of South Africa, mostly off the West Coast (Huyser 2000a). Vagrants have been recorded as far north as Durban, KwaZulu-Natal (Ryan 1997a). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at c. 13 900 pairs, equating to c. 27 800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014n). Crawford et al. (1991) provided a crude estimate of 15 000 birds in the austral winter and 10 000 in the austral summer over the South African continental shelf and shelf-break although this must now be lower given the declines in the global population since 1991. Confidence in the global population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Trend justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is in decline (BirdLife International 2014n). In 1974, the number of breeding pairs in the Tristan da Cunha group was estimated to be 16 000-30 000 (Tristan da Cunha Island), 4 500 (Nightingale Island), 100-200 (Middle Island), 500 (Stoltenhoff Island) (Richardson 1984) and 1 100 (Inaccessible Island) (Fraser et al. 1988). On Gough Island the population was estimated at c. 5 300 breeding pairs in 2000-2001 (Cuthbert and Sommer 2004). These data are now greater than 30 years out of date and there is considerable uncertainty around the overall population estimate. Based on population trend data from study colonies, it is highly likely that the overall population has declined since 1974. On Tristan da Cunha, a reduction of 80-89% was reported (Cuthbert and Sommer 2004). More recent data reports 40 pairs on Middle Island and 210 pairs on Stoltenhoff Island in 2010 (Ryan et al. 2011).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The recent global status change of Near Threatened to Endangered was based upon demographic models which predict decreasing populations at a rate of 1-3% a year at Gough and 5-7% per year at Tristan da Cunha (Cuthbert et al. 2003b, Ryan 2005b). There was a suggested decrease between 1989/1990 and 1999 at Inaccessible Island, although the observers noted that 1999 was possibly a poor breeding year (Ryan and Moloney 2000). Numbers breeding at a single colony on Nightingale Island fell from 3 000 pairs (Richardson 1984) to 1 000 pairs in 1999 (Ryan 2005b). Confidence in this trend estimate is low due to the infrequency in counts and the low proportion of the population that has been surveyed (ACAP 2009b). In addition, some colonies have only received single, crude estimates (ACAP 2009b). The confidence in the global population trend estimate is low.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ecology </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Birds breed annually, arriving in late August to September and are present at breeding colonies until fledging in April (Rowan 1951). Experienced breeders at Gough and Tristan da Cunha attempt to breed every two out of three years with success ranging from 62-72% and 62-76% respectively (Cuthbert et al. 2003b). BirdLife International (2014n) provides a generation length of 23.7 years. Feeds by surface-seizing, surface-plunging and occasional plunge-diving (Marchant and Higgins 1990). The Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross has been recorded scavenging at fishing vessels, where it joins mixed species assemblages, but the species appears to be less dependent on trawler discards than other albatrosses (Ryan and Moloney 1988). </p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross is vulnerable to being caught and drowned on longlines and through interactions with trawl warps (Barnes et al. 1997, Bugoni et al. 2008, Petersen et al. 2009a,b). Survival at Tristan da Cunha is negatively correlated with tuna longline fishing efforts in the South Atlantic Ocean (Cuthbert et al. 2003b). Off Namibia, the species is thought to be one of the most frequently killed seabirds in pelagic longlining and trawling operations (Ryan et al. 2002).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is protected internationally under the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels - Annex 1; the 2012 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species; as well as the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Appendix II). Regionally the species is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), the Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries 2008.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Compliance with regulations and mitigation measures, and more comprehensive data collection, especially with respect to illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, is required.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of Black-browed Albatross Thalassarche melanophrys has declined, and is predicted to continue declining, by greater than 60% over a 64 year period (three generations) at its large breeding colonies in the south-west Atlantic, satisfying criterion A4 (an observed, estimated, inferred, projected or suspected population size reduction of =50% over a three generation period, where the time period must include both the past and the future, and where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible). The species does not breed on the Prince Edward Islands but is a regular visitor to South African territorial waters. The global status is adopted as the regional status.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is currently listed as globally Endangered and was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">First described as Diomedea melanophris by Temminck (1828) and corrected to melanophrys in 1839 (ACAP 2010a). This species shows considerable phenotypic variation and was placed in the newly created genus Thalassarche by Reinbach (1850). Murphy returned all smaller albatrosses back to Diomedea in 1936, although Thalassarche was preserved as a sub-genus containing just the Black-browed Albatross by Jouanin and Mougin (1979). Thalassarche was reinstated at the generic level by Nunn et al. (1996) where the species was placed and eventually split into T. melanophrys and T. impavida (Campbell Albatross) following Robertson and Nunn (1998). BirdLife International and ACAP have adopted this classification.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">81-95 cm, 4 kg. Sexes alike. Adult has white head with dark grey back and tail. Remainder of the upper body white. Bill yellowish-orange with a reddish tip. Underwings white with distinctive broad black margins, especially on the leading edge of the wing. Central white stripe on underwing variable depending on age (darker when younger). Obvious black eyebrow extends behind the eye. Eyes dark brown. Legs and feet pale blue-grey, with pinkish tinge. Juvenile similar to adult but underwing is darker, has grey collar (varying in amount of grey) and bill is grey with a black tip. Brow of juvenile can be darker than adult's, but is smaller. Upperwings as adult (Ryan 2005c).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Black-browed Albatross has a circumpolar distribution, with the majority of breeding birds found in the Subantarctic zone, and the majority of non-breeding birds occurring in subtropical as well as Subantarctic waters (ACAP 2010a). Populations breed on the Falklands Islands, Isla Diego Ramirez, Ildefondo, Diego de Almagro and Isla Evangelistas, South Georgia, Crozet and Kerguelen Islands, Heard and McDonald Islands and Macquarie Island, and Campbell and Antipodes Islands (Croxall and Gales 1998). They occur throughout South African waters, reaching southern Angola and southern Mozambique with their distribution strongly linked to trawling activity (Ryan and Moloney 1988). They can also be found regularly but in low numbers in oceanic waters, concentrating at fronts (Petersen et al. 2008). Most of the Black-browed Albatrosses that forage in the highly productive Benguela Current off the South African coast, originate from South Georgia (Phillips et al. 2004). Very little is known about the distribution of immature Black-browed Albatrosses (ACAP 2010a).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at c. 593 447 breeding pairs (c. 1.15 million mature individuals) comprising of 399 416 pairs (c. 67%) on the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) (Huin and Reid 2007, Strange 2008), 74 296 pairs (c. 13%) on South Georgia (Poncet et al. 2006), 114 608 pairs (c. 20%) in Chile and other populations (Antipodes, Campbell, Heard and MacDonald, Crozet, Kerguelen, Macquarie and Snares; Gales 1998). Crawford et al. (1991) estimated the population in South African waters to be 170 000 birds in the austral winter and 45 000 birds, mostly immatures, in the austral summer. Confidence in this population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is decreasing (ACAP 2010a). Populations at Bird Island (11% of the South Georgia total) declined by 4% per year between 1989-1990 and 2003-2004 (Poncet et al. 2006), while the Kerguelen population declined by 17% between 1978-1979 and 1994-1995 (Weimerskirch and Jouventin 1998). Adult survival on South Georgia decreased from 93% pre-1970 to 89% in 1987, with breeding success also decreasing over the same period from 36% to 18% (Croxall 2008). Numbers at Diego Ramirez may have decreased during the 1980s and recovered recently (Schlatter 1984, Arata and Moreno 2002). Numbers in the Falklands apparently increased substantially during the 1980s (Croxall and Gales 1998, Gales 1998), probably attributable to abundant offal and discards from trawl fisheries (Thompson and Riddy 1995). Previously, the Falklands population was declining at 0.7% per year between 2000 and 2005 (Huin and Reid 2007) though more recently between 2005 and 2010 the breeding numbers have increased by 21.8%, or 4% per year (Catry et al. 2011b, Wolfaardt 2012). The trends are not consistent between years or sites, and between colonies within sites. Trends are still uncertain for the populations in Chile but repeat censuses of the population at the Ildefonso Archipelago, Chile, in 2002 and 2006, suggest that the population remained stable during this period (Robertson et al. 2008). The small population on Heard Island (c. 600 pairs) appears to have increased over the past 50 years (Woehler et al. 2002). The combination of trends across colonies and the past declines in the Falklands, South Georgia and Kerguelen, indicate an overall decline of 67% over 64 years (three generations). Very rapid ongoing declines are suspected overall (Wolfaardt 2012). Confidence in this estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Black-browed Albatross breeds on Subantarctic islands, where it nests in colonies on steep slopes with tussock grass and sometimes on cliff terraces. At the Falkland Islands the species nests on flat ground along the shoreline (ACAP 2010a). Breeding is annual, although only 75% of successful and 67% of failed breeders attempt to breed the following year (Catry et al. 2011b). Individuals arrive at their breeding islands in September, and lay in early October; chicks hatch in December and fledge between April and May (Catry et al. 2011b). Immature birds return to land at around two years old but could be as late as 6 years of age (Catry et al. 2011b). Black-browed Albatrosses are opportunistic foragers mainly feeding on fishery discards and offal (80%), but hunted prey includes pelagic crustaceans (10%) and squid (10%) (Cherel and Klages 1998).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The main threat facing the Black-browed Albatross is through interaction with commercial fisheries, most notably longline fishing, over much of the Patagonian shelf, off South Georgia, off the southern African coast and in the Southern Ocean (Reid and Sullivan 2004, Arnold et al. 2006). The Black-browed Albatross faces land-based threats that would cause population-level changes at any of the breeding sites (ACAP 2010a). Introduced predators have impacted on the numbers of individuals on Macquarie Island since 1999 while the European Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus has led to extensive destruction of habitat and soil erosion at nesting sites (Parks and Wildlife Service and Biodiversity Conservation Branch 2007). An eradication programme targeting rodents commenced in 2010 (ACAP 2010a). Domestic cats Felis catus may have an impact on the colonies on the Kerguelen Islands (Woehler et al. 2002, ACAP 2010a). In more recent years, the effect of trawl fisheries on this species has been found to be another major cause of their decline (Sullivan et al. 2006). In the past, Black-browed Albatrosses were killed by fishermen for food off the South African coast (Ryan and Rose 1989), but this is unlikely to be a major threat currently (BA Maree pers. obs.). Juvenile Black-browed Albatrosses face a minor threat when severe storms and winds exhaust and drive them ashore, causing their death (Ryan et al. 1987). Eggs were once collected for food but this has since been made illegal and is not a major threat. Ingestion of plastic, as well as nylon, rubber and metal wire, remains another threat to Black-browed Albatrosses (Ryan 2008).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Within the region, the South African government has a National Plan of Action for Seabirds (NPOA-S) which although not species-specific, sets guidelines and targets for local fisheries relating to seabird bycatch levels and targets. Fisheries within South Africa, both longline and trawl, have shown strong interest in reducing accidental seabird bycatch. Currently the Black-browed Albatross populations are monitored at South Georgia, Kerguelen, Campbell, Diego Ramirez and the Falklands Islands (ACAP 2010a). Most breeding sites are designated reserves, with Heard and McDonald, Macquarie, and the New Zealand islands being World Heritage sites. Black-browed Albatrosses are protected under the following international listings: Agreement of the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) - Annex 1; 2012 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species - Endangered (since 2003); and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Appendix II) (as Diomedea melanophris). In addition, Black-browed Albatross are listed on various country-specific plans (ACAP 2010a). Regionally the species is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), The Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries 2008.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">All Black-browed Albatross populations should be monitored/continued to be monitored, with full census counts done at all sites at regular intervals (Falklands Islands, South Georgia, Chile and the French Southern Territories), as much of the data is several years outdated (ACAP 2010a). All current research programmes underway at each site should be continued. The impact of both longline and trawl fisheries should be assessed and continued monitoring put in place. Seabird bycatch mitigation measures should be strengthened and made mandatory in all relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisations including the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Fisheries observer programmes should be improved with stronger data reporting requirements, as well as increased access to the data collected. Updating of the National Plan of Action for Seabirds (NPOA-S) for South Africa is required.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Globally, the Grey-headed Albatross Thalassarche chryso&#173;stoma is undergoing population declines over a 90 year (three generation period) of greater than 50% satisfying criterion A4 for qualification as Endangered. The regional population has been quantified at c. 19 000 mature individuals that breed at two locations, namely Prince Edward and Marion islands. The global status of Endangered is adopted as the regional status.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the Prince Edward Islands. In addition, it is currently listed as globally Endangered and was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Forster (1785) originally described this monotypic species as Diomedea chrysostoma. The genus Thalassarche was re-erected in the 1990s following a major taxonomic revision of albatrosses (Nunn et al. 1996), which saw the large, white-backed albatrosses retained in the genus Diomedea and the smaller, dark-backed ‘mollymawk' albatrosses placed in Thalassarche.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">75-85 cm, 3.65 kg. Sexes are alike. A small albatross with a dark ashy grey head, throat and upper neck. Upperwings, mantle and tail blackish. Bill black with bright yellow upper and lower ridges, shading to pink-orange at tip. Underparts white. Underwings white with black on leading edges. Immature birds have mostly black bills, and their heads and napes are darker than adults' with a contrasting white ‘splash' around the base of the bill. In comparison to adult, white eye-crescent is indistinct and there is virtually no white on the underwing (Ryan 2005d).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Grey-headed Albatross disperses widely across the Southern Ocean from breeding sites at several Subantarctic islands including South Georgia, Crozet, Kerguelen, Macquarie, Prince Edward Islands and Campbell as well as the Diego Ramirez and Ildefonso island groups off Chile (Prince et al. 1998). Within the region, the species breeds at two sites, namely Marion Island and Prince Edward Island, occupying a total AoO of 334 km2 (Nel et al. 2002a). Adults are mostly confined south of 40° S and seldom venture into continental shelf waters with the majority of records off South Africa being of immature birds.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global annual breeding population has been quantified at c. 192 000 mature individuals with the Prince Edward Islands holding roughly 11% of this total (ACAP 2010b). The Prince Edward Island and Marion Island populations are c. 4 000 and c. 15 000 mature individuals respectively, giving a regional annual breeding population of c. 19 000 mature individuals (Ryan et al. 2009a). The confidence in this regional population estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is in decline having decreased by 15% since the mid-1980s (BirdLife International 2014o). Provided current trends continue into the future, declines can be expected to equate to 50% over three generations (90 years). In contrast to the global trend, the number of breeding pairs on Marion Island has increased by 2.5% per year from a low in 1975 until the early 1990s, and at a slower, but appreciable rate thereafter (Nel et al. 2002a, Ryan et al. 2009a). Trend information is not available for Prince Edward Island. The mean annual adult survival rate between 1998 and 2005 was 93%, which is not worryingly low but is not as high as it should be ideally (ACAP 2010b). Confidence in the regional population trend estimate (Marion Island) is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Grey-headed Albatross breeds in colonies on vegetated cliffs close to the coast at Marion and Prince Edward islands (Cooper 2000b). Unlike the majority of the genus Thalassarche, it breeds biennially, although 5.4% of successful breeders on Marion Island attempt to breed annually (Ryan et al. 2009a). The generation length of 30 years was calculated based on a published estimate of mean age at first breeding and a published estimate of mean annual survival (BirdLife International 2014o). Adults cover distances of up to 4 000 km to forage during the incubating period (Nel et al. 2000). It normally occurs singly at sea but readily joins large mixed species aggregations at fishing vessels. Grey-headed Albatrosses feed predominantly by surface-seizing but are also capable of diving up to 6 m (Huin and Prince 1997) to seize food. Diet composition is predominantly fish (Hunter and Klages 1989) although it has been known to take advantage of penguin carrion. </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat faced by Grey-headed Albatrosses is from the longline fishing industry (Nel et al. 2000). Satellite tracking of breeding birds from Marion Island has shown that their foraging ranges fall within areas of longlining activity for both tuna and toothfish. Birds foraging away from the Prince Edward Islands, and in particular incubating females, come into contact with intensive longline fishing effort for Southern Bluefin Tuna Thunnus maccoyii in international waters around 40-45° S (Nel et al. 2000). During the breeding season, adult male birds encounter boats targeting Patagonian Toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides in the shelf waters off the Prince Edward Islands, but incidental seabird mortalities in this fishery have been reduced to zero (Ryan 2005d). Historically, Grey-headed Albatrosses made up 3.2% of all birds killed between 1993 and 1997, despite only accounting for 0.4% of birds attending the vessels (Weimerskirch et al. 2000). The shift in fishing effort away from the islands as well as implementation of mitigation measures have resulted in a decrease in the number of mortalities recorded (Nel et al. 2002a). However, birds are still threatened by other commercial operations due to their circumpolar distribution. Ingestion of plastic litter may be a potential threat (Nel et al. 2002a) but has to be quantified. There are no known threats to birds breeding at the Prince Edward Islands themselves, although predation of chicks by mice is of concern.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Indications of an increasing regional population suggest that general measures to reduce seabird bycatch in fisheries have been successful. The Grey-headed Albatross receives protection in South Africa under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Publication of Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch on Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (2008). Distribution overlaps with the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. Various stringent guidelines are in place to prevent pollution, contamination, disturbance and introduction of pathogens or invasive organisms on the islands. Visits to Prince Edward Island are strictly controlled.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ongoing monitoring of the population trends via annual census of adults and of large chicks should continue at Marion Island. Irregular visits to Prince Edward Island should attempt to count standardised sections of the breeding cliffs (if not the entire colony). Alternatively, aerial photography to census the cliffs should be conducted during the incubation period.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional breeding population of Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross Thalassarche carteri has been quantified at c. 7 000 mature individuals which breed at a single location in the region, namely Prince Edward Island. The species is globally Endangered due to an inferred and predicted continuous decline of greater than 50% over a 71 year period (three generations) satisfying criterion A4 (an observed, estimated, inferred, projected or suspected population size reduction of =50% over a three generation period, where the time period must include both the past and the future, and where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible). The global status of Endangered is adopted as the regional status. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">17% of the global Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross population breeds on Prince Edward Island. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Endangered in 2015. The species occurs in large numbers within 200 nm of South Africa.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The genus Thalassarche was re-erected in the 1990s following a major taxonomic revision of albatrosses, which saw the large, white-backed albatrosses retained in the genus Diomedea and the smaller, dark-backed ‘mollymawk' albatrosses placed in Thalassarche (Nunn et al. 1996). This revision recognised the Atlantic T. chlororhynchos and Indian forms T. carteri of yellow-nosed albatrosses as separate species.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">75-80 cm, 2.55 kg. Sexes alike. The smallest black-and-white albatross. Adult has very pale grey or white head and nape leading into dark grey mantle, upperwing, and tail. Rump white. Underparts white, with white underwing featuring a black tip and narrow margin at leading edge. Bill is black with yellow upper ridge and reddish tip. Juvenile has a white head and black bill (Ryan 2005e).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the French Subantarctic island groups of Amsterdam, St Paul, Crozet, the Kerguelen Islands and on South Africa's Prince Edward Island (Ryan et al. 2009a). From these islands it disperses widely across the southern Indian Ocean moving marginally into the east Atlantic and west Pacific oceans. The exact distribution in the South Atlantic Ocean is little known due to confusion with the Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross (Ryan 2005e). The species is common off the south and east coasts of South Africa, but rarely ventures further north than 20°S.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at c. 41 500 breeding pairs (BirdLife International 2014p). The regional population is estimated to be c. 7 000 pairs equating to roughly 17% of the global population (Ryan et al. 2009a). Confidence in this population estimate is low as the population estimate included considerable extrapolation. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Globally the species was estimated to have declined at a rate of greater than 50% over three generations assuming a continuous decline at Amsterdam Island (BirdLife International 2014p). The Amsterdam Island calculations were based on a study plot, which declined at 3.7% per year in 1978-2005, while the whole Amsterdam Island population declined by c. 1.3% yearly between 1982-2006 (BirdLife International 2014p). Although current data suggest the Prince Edward Island population is stable, this is not based on long-term data. Of the six islands that the species breeds on, only on Amsterdam Island have there been any regular surveys of breeding pairs (ACAP 2009c). It is quite possible that there are long-term declines at Prince Edward Island taking place in line with the decrease in the global population. This is however impossible to detect with the short time-series available. Confidence in the regional population trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross nests colonially and is an annual breeding species, with each breeding cycle lasting about eight months (ACAP 2009c). A generation length of 23.7 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014p). It occurs singly or in groups at sea but readily joins aggregations of seabirds at fishing vessels (Ryan 2005e). The feeding behaviour is characterised by surface-seizing and shallow dives (ACAP 2009c). On average, adult survival is around 88%, which is lower than most other albatrosses (Veran et al. 2007).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no known threats to breeding birds at Prince Edward Island itself. Disease recorded from Amsterdam Island (Weimerskirch 2004) has not been recorded at Prince Edward Island and there are no introduced predators. Threats at sea are primarily from bycatch in tuna longline fishing as well as through being drowned when accidentally entangled in trawl fishing cables in demersal trawl fishing in South African territorial waters (Watkins et al. 2008, Maree et al. 2014). Trawling on sea-mounts in the south-western Indian Ocean is a potential threat but data are lacking. Likewise, ingestion of plastic litter may be a potential threat to the species but needs to be quantified.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources has implemented highly effective measures to prevent accidental mortality of birds during longline fishing operations for toothfish. BirdLife South Africa's Albatross Task force is actively researching new technologies to reduce incidental mortality, particularly in tuna longline fisheries, which threaten this species and other seabirds. It also supports the construction and distribution of devices such as Bird Scaring Lines for fishing vessels for domestic and foreign fleets that visit Cape Town harbour. BirdLife International is actively lobbying regional fisheries management organisations to improve the data collection and reporting on how vessels are implementing the relevant conservation measures required of longline fishing vessels in the various oceans. It is also supporting efforts to train various fleets in use of best-practice seabird bycatch mitigation measures. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. In addition, the species is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), The Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries 2008.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ongoing measures by BirdLife South Africa and BirdLife International to improve relationships with pelagic longline fishing operations and reduce incidental mortality of seabirds should be supported and extended to distant water fishing nations operating in the Southern Ocean. The South African Government should promote international best-practice for reducing seabird mortalities through forums such as the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, including through acceding to best-practice agreements. Regional and national observer programmes and reporting of their data remain of paramount importance in understanding the scale of incidental mortality and potential effectiveness of (and level of compliance with) mitigation measures employed. Support for programmes to census the sub-population of the Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross at Prince Edward Island more regularly (possibly through less intrusive census measures such as aerial photography), and tracking of birds to assess the degree of overlap with various fisheries operations, remain important tools for assessing and addressing the ongoing threats from fishery interactions to seabirds.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Northern Royal Albatross Diomedea sanfordi is listed as globally Endangered due to a projected decline of greater than 50% over the next 81 year period (three generations) satisfying criterion A4 (an observed, estimated, inferred, projected or suspected population size reduction of =50% over a three generation period, where the time period must include both the past and the future, and where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible). The Northern Royal Albatross occurs as a non-breeding visitor in South African waters and the regional assessment follows the global status for this species.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species is increasingly being recorded in South African waters and is currently listed as globally Endangered. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There has been substantial debate regarding the taxonomy of this species. The species was originally described by Murphy in 1917 but later was considered to be a subspecies of the Southern Royal Albatross Diomedea epomophora (Sibley and Monroe 1990). Robertson and Nunn (1998) restored the Northern Royal Albatross back to D. sanfordi (see also Brooke (2004)) based on several key morphological differences between the two taxa. D. sanfordi is treated as a separate species by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, as well as BirdLife International, several recent monographs and guides of Southern Ocean seabirds (Brooke 2004, Onley and Scofield 2007, Shirihai and Kirwan 2008). Birdlife South Africa recognises the split and this assessment accordingly deals with D. sanfordi.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">107-115 cm, 6.5 kg. A large, white-backed albatross. Black upperwing with white head, body, rump and tail. Underwing is white with a narrow black trailing edge, broadening on the tip and extending onto the leading edge of the wing. Eyes dark brown and legs and feet pale pink, washed greyish blue. Juvenile similar to adult except for some black in the outer tail, as well as black mottling on the back and rump. Both adult and juvenile birds have a pink bill with a thin black line along the cutting edge, visible at close range (Ryan 2005f).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Northern Royal Albatrosses are a breeding endemic to New Zealand with the majority (greater than 99%) of the population breeding on the Chatham Islands. The remaining individuals breed at Taiaroa Head on the Otago Peninsula of New Zealand's South Island (Croxall and Gales 1998, Robertson 1998, Robertson and Nunn 1998). Breeding birds can be found foraging close to their breeding sites, over shallow waters of the Chatham Rise out to the shelf edge (1 500-2 000 m deep; Nicholls et al. 1994, Nicholls et al. 2002).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Birds that have either failed in a breeding attempt or are not breeding, including newly fledged juveniles, travel across the Pacific Ocean to the continental shelf off Chile and the Patagonian Shelf (Nicholls et al. 2002). They are more widespread along the Patagonian Shelf, approximately 200-350 km offshore in water depths of less than200 m deep (but can extend to the shelf-break to depths of 1 000 m) at 36-49° S (Nicholls et al. 2002). Birds are also found further south, near the Falklands Islands (Islas Malvinas) along the shelf west of the islands (Nicholls et al. 2002). Probably overlooked in the past but now observed regularly off Western Cape, occurring mostly over the continental shelf between the Orange River, Northern Cape to Cape Agulhas, Western Cape (Nicholls et al. 1994, Ryan 2005f).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at c. 25 000-26 000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014q), 99% of which occur on the Chatham Islands. A 2012 count recorded 5 800 pairs on this island group (counted at the end of egg-laying) with c. 1 700 pairs on sabbatical after breeding in the previous season (BirdLife International 2014q). Approximately 25 pairs breed at Taiaroa Head, including five hybrids which have descended from a cross with a female Southern Royal Albatross. Confidence in the global estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is in decline (BirdLife International 2014q). Severe storms in the 1980s resulted in a decrease in habitat quality at the Chatham Islands, which led to poor breeding success. Based on this low breeding success, the population is estimated to have undergone and be undergoing a very rapid continuing decline over three generations. Taiaroa Head (representing 0.5% of the total population) has had ongoing monitoring since 1937 but despite the varying quality of the records, it is clear this population is increasing (Croxall and Gales 1998). The decline is projected to be greater than 50% over a 81 year (three generation) period. Confidence in this trend estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A regular ship follower, being more tolerant of dense aggregations of birds behind trawlers than the related Wandering Albatross D. exulans (Ryan 2005f). Prey is made up of predominantly squid (80-85% by mass), fish (15%), crustaceans, tunicates and occasionally scavenged penguin carcasses (Cherel and Klages 1998). Breeding success at Taiaroa Head is approximately 60% based on research between 1999 and 2008 (Unpubl. data, referenced in ACAP 2009a). A generation length of 27 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014q). Breeding success on the Chatham Islands is much lower due to severe storms in 1985 which destroyed nesting habitat. Data from 1990 to 1996 suggests that mean breeding success on the Forty Fours is 8% and on Chatham Islands is 18% (Robertson 1998). These levels of reproductive output are insufficient to sustain a population of Diomedea albatrosses (Wanless et al. 2009).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Unlike in many other albatross species, fisheries-related mortality is not thought to be a major threat to the Northern Royal Albatross. While this species is occasionally killed in longline fisheries around New Zealand, Australia, Brazil and Uruguay, it is subject to low capture rates (Taylor and Unit 2000, Bugoni et al. 2008). However, of concern is that observer coverage as a proportion of total fishing effort is low, limiting confidence in the low observed mortality rates (Favero et al. 2003, Waugh et al. 2008). In the past local residents of the Chatham Islands exploited Northern Royal Albatross in significant numbers (Tickell 2000) but this has mostly ended.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Albatross Task Force (ATF) teams in nine countries are recording seabird bycatch within local fisheries. These at-sea threats should be monitored and maintained through mitigation strategies (including intergovernmental agreements) at acceptable levels (Garnett et al. 2011). Predator control at Taiaroa Head during the breeding season results in comparatively high annual productivity (Croxall and Gales 1998). Feral cattle, rabbits and mice have been eradicated from Enderby Island (Taylor and Unit 2000). The species is listed in the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels - Annex 1, and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals - Appendix II. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Intensive monitoring/census and management of populations in Taiaroa Head and Chatham Islands (annual surveys)is ongoing. Ensure best practise mitigation measures are implemented in all fisheries in which the Northern Royal Albatross interacts. Ensure all pelagic longline effort in South African waters is monitored through independent observer programmes and compliance with measures to prevent incidental mortality, and all mortality events, are recorded. Continue development, testing and implementation of new mitigation measures in the longline fishing industry. The National Plan of Action for Seabirds of South Africa should be updated.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of Sooty Albatross Phoebetria fusca is suspected to be undergoing a decline of greater than 50% over a ninety year (three generation) period satisfying criterion A4 (an observed, estimated, inferred, projected or suspected population size reduction of =50% over a three generation period, where the time period must include both the past and the future, and where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible). In addition, the species breeds at only two locations in the region, namely Prince Edward Island and Marion Island. The regional assessment follows the global status.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Sooty Albatross breeds at the Prince Edward Islands and is a regular visitor to South African continental waters. It was assessed in 2000 as regionally Near Threatened and is currently listed as globally Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">85-90 cm, 2.4-2.7 kg. Sexes alike, but male slightly larger. A medium-sized, slender, uniform sooty-brown albatross, lacking the paler contrasting upperparts of Light-mantled Albatross P. palpebrata. Tail diamond-shaped. Slightly darker on the sides of the head with a white crescent above and behind the eye. The bill is black with a yellow sulcus. Juvenile and immature plumage is similar to adult (Ryan 2005g).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Sooty Albatross breeds on Prince Edward Island and Marion Island, as well as Iles de Kerguelen, Iles Crozet, Ile Amsterdam and Ile Saint Paul, Gough and the Tristan da Cunha islands (ACAP 2010c). Although there is little known regarding its movements (Ryan 2005g), it is believed to range widely across the Southern Ocean, seldom venturing into continental shelf waters (Ryan 1997b).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The total annual global breeding population is estimated at c. 14 000 pairs (ACAP 2010c). This consists of c. 5 000 pairs on Gough Island (Cuthbert and Sommer 2004), 3 157 pairs in the Tristan da Cunha group (ACAP 2010c), c. 1 400 pairs on Prince Edward Island as well as c. 1 400 pairs on Marion Island (Ryan et al. 2009a), 2 174 pairs on the Iles Crozet (Delord et al. 2008), fewer than five pairs on Iles Kerguelen and 300-400 pairs on Iles Amsterdam (ACAP 2010c). Ryan et al. (2009a) estimated there to be 1 400 pairs on Prince Edward Island and Marion Island respectively, giving a regional population of c. 2 800 pairs. Sooty Albatrosses are difficult to survey due to their dark plumage and cliff-nesting habits (Ryan et al. 2009a), lowering the confidence in this estimate to medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Limited information is available to determine global population trends for the species but declines have been reported at all sites where repeated surveys have been carried out (ACAP 2010c). The Marion Island population decreased by 25% between 1990 and 1998 or at about 2.6% per year (Crawford et al. 2003b), but increased by c. 5% per year up to 2005 (Ryan et al. 2009a), undergoing a further slight decrease until 2008 (Ryan et al. 2009a). The Prince Edward Island population appears to have increased over a similar period although this may be due to different survey methods being employed. Overall, the Prince Edward Islands population appears to be stable. Confidence in this trend estimate is moderate.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Sooty Albatross nests singly or in small colonies and is a biennial breeder laying a single egg (Weimerskirch et al. 1986). Birds show high fidelity to sites, with egg-laying taking place from mid-September to late October, although this is synchronised within each colony (ACAP 2010c). A generation length of 30 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014r). Feeding is mainly through surface-seizing with squid, fish and crustaceans featuring prominently in the diet (Cooper and Klages 1995). It is an infrequent follower of ships (Ryan 2005g).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat at sea is from bycatch in tuna longline fishing (Nel et al. 2002a, Petersen et al. 2009a). Trawling on sea-mounts in the south-west Indian Ocean is a potential threat but data are lacking. Population decreases are considered to be due to at-sea mortality associated with fisheries, particularly longline fishing vessels (Delord et al. 2008). Introduced House Mice Mus musculus have been reported to have preyed upon a single chick on Marion Island (Jones and Ryan 2010). Mice are absent from Prince Edward Island.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is listed by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels - Annex 1 and by the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals - Appendix II. Within the region it is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Publication of Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch on Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (2008). The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and protected by the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan, 1996.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Efforts by BirdLife International and BirdLife South Africa to reduce incidental mortality of seabirds should be supported. Observer programmes reporting on the scale of incidental mortality and potential effectiveness of mitigation measures, must be continued. Eradication of introduced House Mice on Marion Island should be considered, based inter alia upon results of research into the patterns and scale of mouse predation on Sooty Albatross chicks.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Green Barbet Stactolaema olivacea satisfies the range criterion of B1 for regionally Endangered (extent of occurrence less than5 000 km2, occurring at a single location and a predicted decline in extent and quality of habitat) as well as B2 (area of occupancy less than500 km2, occurring at a single location and a predicted decline in extent and quality of habitat).</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional sub-population occurs at a single locality and is separated by 2 300 km from its closest apparent congener in the forests of the Rondo Plateau, Tanzania. The species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The taxonomy of this species is unclear. Clancey (1964) considered the Green Barbet to comprise two isolated populations (Ngoye Forest and Rondo Plateau) and that two more species, C. belcheri and C. olivacea exist in Malawi, Kenya and Tanzania. An alternative view is that the group comprises one species with five subspecies (Fry et al. 1988). The conservation status of the Green Barbet is heavily dependent upon its taxonomic status and this should be reviewed. As a precautionary measure, this assessment follows Clancey (1989).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">16-18.5 cm. 50 g. Sexes are alike. Forehead to nape dark olive-brown. Upperparts bronzy green. Throat, belly and underparts light green. Underwing coverts yellowish white. Bill and legs dark brown to blackish. Eyes red. The Ngoye Forest and Rondo Plateau birds differ from C. belcheri and C. olivacea by having distinctive lemon yellow superciliary streaks, ear coverts and temporal surfaces (Clancey 1989).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Green Barbet group is distributed in a disrupted chain of isolated populations from coastal Kenya and north-eastern Kenya, Malawi and Mozambique to South Africa (Clancey 1989). Within the region, it occurs at a single locality, Ngoye Forest in KwaZulu-Natal (Berruti 2000a, Chittenden 2005b), a patch of relict Afromontane and coastal forest (Berruti 1997a). Birds are more common in the higher-lying parts of the western side of the forest and scarcer in the eastern sector (Johnson et al. 1998). The EoO is 110 km2 while the AoO is just 39 km2. The Green Barbet is not known to undertake any movements outside of the forest (Cyrus and Robson 1980). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014s). The most recent estimate of the regional population is that of Chittenden et al. (1999) who provided a figure of 400-600 mature individuals. The population is thought to be stable, so this figure is taken as the current population size. Confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>

	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In the most recent revision of the species, Chittenden (2005b) chose not to adjust the population estimate from the 1999 estimate, indicating that the population trend over three generations had been stable. Confidence in this estimate is moderate.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Green Barbet is restricted to a single locality, Ngoye Forest (Berruti 2000a, Chittenden 2005b). Within this area, it is confined to coastal scarp forest with tall canopy (Chittenden et al. 1999, Chittenden 2005b). This species may be particularly dependent on the fruit of wild figs Ficus spp., of which seven species occur in Ngoye Forest and on its edges (Dowsett-Lemaire and Dowsett 1987). The bird occurs in small groups of 3-8 in the upper half of the forest canopy during the non-breeding season, breaking up into pairs from about October (Chittenden 2005b) to breed. It nests in holes in tree trunks from November to February (Holliday and Tait 1953). A generation length of 8.5 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014s).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ongoing human exploitation of the forest is a concern that has been raised repeatedly (Johnson et al. 1998, Chittenden 2005b), but appears to be unchanged. 
	Damage and death to some fruiting trees (e.g. Onionwood Cassipourea malosana) as well as other favoured medicinal trees within the forest, pose a problem. The edge of the forest is subjected to burning, which may gradually reduce the forest area.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Ngoye Forest is listed as a Provincial Nature Reserve under the administration of Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife. Although the Green Barbet's entire regional population thus falls within a protected area, inadequate resources are currently available for the reserve's management. There are no current conservation actions for the species.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Adequate protection of Ngoye Forest is critical to ensure the longevity of this population. Improved forest management is also essential, including an immediate reduction in illegal forest utilisation. A research programme directed at estimating population size and monitoring breeding success of the Green Barbet at Ngoye Forest should be initiated. The species is sought-after by birdwatchers and a responsible ecotourism programme could encourage involvement of local communities and safeguarding of the forest.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the attractive Bateleur Terathopius ecaudatus satisfies the population trend criterion of A1 for regionally Endangered (an observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population-size reduction of =50% over the past three generations (41 years), where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible). In addition, the population size is estimated to number less than1 000 mature individuals and a continuing decline of at least 20% within the next two generations (27 years) is predicted, satisfying criterion C1.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Bateleur was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">55-70 cm, 2.25 kg. Sexes differ slightly in plumage. Adults are unmistakable with mostly black plumage and chestnut mantle, back and tail. Bill is yellow-orange with black tip. Bare facial skin, legs and feet bright red. Males have darker greater upperwing coverts (grey-brown in females). Underwing of both sexes mostly white; black trailing edge narrow in male but broad in female. Juvenile plumage light brown; tail longer than adult's, extending slightly beyond toes in flight; bill black. (Simmons 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species is restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, although a small population exists in the Arabian Peninsula (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In southern Africa, it is found throughout South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and southern Mozambique (Simmons 2005b). Within the region, the species has been largely extirpated outside of protected areas, with Kruger National Park now holding the majority of the regional population, followed by Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and the northern KwaZulu-Natal parks of Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park and iSimangaliso Wetland Park. The adults are largely sedentary (Brown et al. 1982), while juveniles disperse from their natal areas (Simmons 2005b). Two atlas records from Beaufort West in Western Cape and Kenton on Sea in Eastern Cape probably represent vagrant records and not a shift in the distribution of the regional population and explain the increase in EoO. The AoO, on the other hand, has shown a decrease of 38% since SABAP1.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014t). Barnes (2000c) estimated the regional population at c. 1 400 mature individuals in 2000, although no mention was made of the manner in which this estimate was obtained. Watson and Maritz (2000) reported that, although Bateleur populations were stable in the protected-area network in South Africa, there had been a virtual 100% decline outside of these areas from the 1940s to 1980s. SABAP2 data indicate a 38% decrease in AoO since SABAP1. In addition to this, reporting rates within the species' strongholds, namely Kruger National Park and Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, are lower in SABAP2 than in SABAP1. It has also declined in Swaziland, from a previous population of 25 breeding pairs to just four pairs (Monadjem and Rasmussen 2008). The species is highly visible as well as easily recognisable and it is unlikely that it was under-reported during the atlasing periods. Taking into account the reported decreases, the regional population is estimated at c. 900 mature individuals. Confidence in this regional population estimate is moderate to low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The overall rate of decline in the global population is difficult to estimate, but is suspected to have been moderately rapid over the past 41 years or three generations (BirdLife International 2014t). Assuming that the estimate of 1 400 provided by Barnes (2000b) was correct, and based upon a current regional population of c. 900 mature individuals, the decrease in the region has been c. 73% over the past three generations. Confidence in this regional population trend estimate is moderate to low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is found in savannah and open to moderately dense woodland, including Kalahari thornveld, Vachellia (Acacia) savannah and Mopane Colophospermum mopane woodlands (Simmons 1997a, Simmons 2005b) as well as semi-desert shrubland. It is absent from mountains, heavily wooded and treeless habitats. The species is a scavenger and hunter with juveniles and immatures in Kruger National Park scavenging up to 85% of prey items. The species can cover up to 400 km per day while foraging (Elwell 2000). The generation length is 13.7 years (BirdLife International 2014t).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Habitat transformation, which has led to a decrease in the available prey base, is most likely the leading reason for the Bateleur's demise outside of protected areas (Barnes 2000b). Its tendency to scavenge puts this species at particular risk from indiscriminate poisoning, especially by small-stock farmers (Watson 1986). Even birds within protected areas, such as the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, may have declined due to persecution and poisoning from stock farmers outside of the park (Barnes 2000b), illustrating the importance of buffer zones around protected areas. Illegal harvesting of this species for use in the muthi trade is a recent trend, which needs to be further investigated. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Bird of Prey Working Group of the Endangered Wildlife Trust has been active with an awareness and education programme for land-owners and stock farmers in Northern Cape, which has been successful in reducing the number of poisoning incidents (AJ Botha pers. comm.). The Bateleur is listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal of the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No 7 of 2003. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. The awareness programme run by Endangered Wildlife Trust needs to be expanded to parts of the species' former range. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Ludwig's Bustard Neotis ludwigii is projected to undergo a reduction of greater than 50% to be met within the next three generations (30 years) based on an index of abundance applied to the taxon, satisfying criterion A4. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The vast majority of the global range falls in the region. In addition, the species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Endangered in 2015.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">76-97 cm, 2.2-6.0 kg. Sexes dimorphic in plumage colouration, and male considerably larger. Head dark brown with paler flecking on supercilium and lores; crown may have indistinct whitish median stripe. Hind-neck and upper mantle orange with white nape. Upperparts mottled brown and buff with darker brown vermiculations. Tail broadly barred dark brown and creamy white. Upperwing coverts mottled brown. Primary coverts largely white with flight feathers blackish brown with white patches on inner primaries. Foreneck and upper breast brown. Remainder of underparts including flanks and undertail white. Bill horn. Eyes brown. Legs greenish or greyish brown. Female differs in having a more heavily speckled, paler head and foreneck; upperparts of females are more heavily mottled (Allan 2005b). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ludwig's Bustard is near-endemic to the region occurring in western Namibia and western South Africa, with scattered records from south-western Angola (Dean 2000), Botswana (Penry and Jahns 1994) and western Lesotho (Bonde 1993). This species also occurs marginally in south-western Botswana (Allan 2005b). Within the region, it occurs predominantly in the dry Karoo region of western South Africa (Herholdt 1988), extending eastwards into Free State, southwards into Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces and northwards into Northern Cape. Brooke (1984) suggested that the historical distribution extended to the eastern and north-eastern portions of the Grassland Biome.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In the late 1980s the global population was estimated at 56 000-81 000 individuals (Allan 1994), with 50-75% of these thought to occur in the region (Anderson 2000e). The 2000 Red Data Book assessment (Anderson 2000e) provides a regional population estimate of 27 000-60 000 birds. The current regional population is unknown but certainly suspected to be greater than 10 000 mature individuals. Confidence in this regional estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is in decline. Anderson (2000b) projected a 20% decrease in the population over the next thirty years. The power network in the region is extensive and increasing, and causes high levels of mortality with unsustainable rates of 0.63 fatal collisions/km/year being recorded on transmission lines in the Karoo, which result in an estimated annual toll of 8 600 birds (Jenkins et al. 2011b). Worryingly, these current mortality estimates are conservative as they have not been adjusted for various survey biases as well as the impact of low voltage power-lines and telephone wires (Jenkins et al. 2011b). Modelling indicates that a population reduction of greater than 50% is likely in the next 30 years (three generations). Confidence in this regional population trend is moderate.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ludwig's Bustard occurs in the flat, open, semi-arid shrublands of the Succulent Karoo, Nama Karoo and Namib (Allan 1994). It is tolerant of a variety of habitats and, depending on rainfall, may be found in the western grasslands of Free State and Eastern Cape, the southern Kalahari and cultivated fields and pastures (Allan 1994). Ludwig's Bustard is a K-selected species with large body size, long life expectancy and the production of few offspring, and would therefore be slow to recover from any severe impact on its population (Anderson 2000e). A generation length of 10.3 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014u).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Mortalities originating from collisions with distribution and telephone lines is the main threat to the regional Ludwig's Bustard population. Ludwig's Bustard is also impacted upon by hunting, poisoning and disturbance (Anderson 2000e). Falconers from the Middle East have expressed an interest in hunting Ludwig's Bustard and other members of the Otididae. This form of hunting has proven to be unsustainable resulting in the near elimination of the Houbara Bustard Chlamydotis undulta (Anderson 2000e) and poses a threat to regional bustard species including Ludwig's Bustard. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In 2010, BirdLife South Africa formed the Bustard Working Group, which connects interested parties involved in the conservation of species belonging to this family. The Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African of Ornithology is a) conducting a new census of the Ludwig's Bustard population in the region, to compare with the previous assessment in the 1980s; b) assessing the magnitude of power-line mortality through regular line surveys across the Karoo; c) investigating habitat use, and patterns of local and regional movement of bustards through satellite tracking and stable isotope analysis in relation to environmental conditions and the power grid; and d) exploring mitigation options through experimentation of line-marking devices and visual assessment of bustards. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Continuing to raise awareness to stop hunting of this species, and for the public to report mortalities from power-lines would be beneficial. New infrastructure (power-lines, wind turbines) must be sited and managed appropriately, and dangerous sections of line should be fitted with mitigation measures. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The poorly known Black-rumped Buttonquail Turnix nanus has a small and fragmented regional population, estimated to be less than1 000 mature individuals, with no sub-populations likely to exceed 250 mature individuals, satisfying criterion B2. It is dependent on grasslands that have been much reduced and are under severe threat, qualifying it as regionally Endangered. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was listed as regionally Endangered in the 2000 regional assessment. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Previously considered conspecific with the Hottentot Buttonquail T. hottentottus by many authorities (Dowsett and Dowsett-Lemaire 1993, Maclean 1993, del Hoyo et al. 1996). However, Sibley and Monroe (1990) suggested the two taxa constitute different species; this taxonomic treatment is supported by their allopatric ranges and different habitat preferences and possibly movement patterns (Dean 2005a) as well as subtle differences in plumage. Ryan and Hockey (1995) urged that a thorough reassessment of the taxonomic status is critical for any future conservation decisions; a split between nanus and hottentottus (s.s.) is currently accepted by BirdLife International (2014v,w), BirdLife South Africa (Lotz 2015) and the International Ornithologists' Union (Gill and Donsker 2015). Darker northern populations, previously recognised as races luciana and insolata, are now considered indistinguishable from the nominate nanus, making the species monotypic (del Hoyo et al. 1996).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">14-15 cm, 42-60 g. Sexes differ slightly in plumage colour and size. Both sexes intricately patterned in brown, black and rich rufous-buff above, feathers with white tips or fringes. Blackish rump and uppertail coverts, usually obvious in flight, distinguish this species from Hottentot Buttonquail T. hottentottus and Common Buttonquail T. sylvaticus. Crown dark, lacking pale central stripe; offset against orange-buff face and supercilium. Throat white to pale orange-rufous. Breast rich orange-rufous, with conspicuous black and white bars on sides of breast and flanks; belly whitish. Remiges dark sepia; wing coverts rich buff, variably patterned with blackish brown and white. Female similar but slightly larger, and with more confined barring below and broad rufous-buff inner webs to tertials. Bill horn-coloured; eyes white to pale blue; legs and feet dusky-white to pale flesh (Urban et al. 1986). Distinguished from T. hottentottus by less profusely marked underparts, darker rump contrasting with rest of upperparts, more distinct supercilium, bluish white (not pale yellow) irides and whitish flesh (not yellow) legs (del Hoyo et al. 1996). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A secretive and easily overlooked species that is widespread but generally sparse in moist woodland belts, savannah and grassland in sub-Saharan Africa. Occurs from Senegal and Gambia eastwards to Uganda and western Kenya, and south through much of central Africa to northern Angola, Zambia and Malawi (Urban et al. 1986). In Zimbabwe, recorded from the south-eastern Lowveld, and also from across the Mashonaland Plateau between Harare and Marondera, where it is an itinerant and nomadic visitor, mostly in the rainy season (Irwin 1981, Allan and Colahan 1997). Status uncertain in Mozambique, and probably widely overlooked; north of the Save River considered an uncommon breeding summer migrant to moist grasslands, and fairly numerous on low-lying plains from Beira northwards (Parker 2005); in southern Mozambique recorded from a few scattered localities in summer (Parker 1999). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Within the region, the Black-rumped Buttonquail's occurrence is generally patchy and erratic, but its secretive behaviour, cryptic plumage and imperfectly known movement patterns ensure that it is widely under-recorded, or misidentified (Christian 2004). Based on limited atlas and specimen data, there appears to be two apparently isolated centres of distribution: south-eastern Mpumalanga, Swaziland and northern KwaZulu-Natal (contiguous with populations in southern Mozambique); and southern KwaZulu-Natal and the adjacent Eastern Cape, where it is probably more widespread than current records indicate, especially in the former Transkei (Quickelberge 1989). It is considered a rare, but probably breeding resident in Swaziland (Parker 1994). The Black-rumped Buttonquail was not listed for Lesotho by Bonde (1993), but may occasionally occur in small numbers, especially in the western lowlands. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The relatively large EoO but small AoO reflects the localised and fragmented range of this species, which was estimated at less than1 750 km2 by Taylor (2000). Recent SABAP2 data suggest an AoO of c. 5 200 km2, although only a small percentage of this area constitutes suitable habitat and the estimate provided by Taylor (2000) is more likely. The overall distribution is reminiscent of that of the Short-tailed Pipit Anthus brachyurus, and the two species ostensibly have similar ecological requirements and movement patterns, and often occur in close proximity. Bearing this in mind, searches should be made for Black-rumped Buttonquails in areas where the pipit occurs, including newly discovered locations in Eastern Cape and on the outskirts of Gauteng. Indeed, both species were recently discovered in large numbers near Verena, western Mpumalanga (well outside of their known ranges), where they were suspected to be breeding.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size is unknown (BirdLife International 2014v). Brooke (1984) classified this species as one of the five most threatened birds in South Africa, and speculated that it may now be mostly a vagrant that no longer breeds in the region. Based on estimates in Barnes (1998), a total of 212-584 birds possibly occurred in 13 IBAs in eastern South Africa, while Parker (1994) estimated a population of 70 birds in Swaziland. It may be locally common in optimal breeding habitat, and Christian (2004) reported that between November and February the hooting of female Black-rumped Buttonquails was heard almost continually at a breeding site near Cato Ridge, KwaZulu-Natal, with at least five hooting females (plus an unknown number of males) present in the small study area, and probably many more in the extensive surrounding habitat. Likewise, at least four birds were found in 8 ha at Vernon Crookes Nature Reserve in southern KwaZulu-Natal (Christian 2004). Taylor (2000) suggested the total regional population may be in the order of 1 000 birds, but confidence in this estimate is low given that this species is so easily overlooked. No up to date population estimates are available although the regional population is almost certainly less than1 000 mature individuals.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Globally, the species is suspected to be in decline owing to on-going habitat destruction and unsustainable levels of exploitation (BirdLife International 2014v). The regional population is likewise thought to have undergone a severe and continuing decline owing to deterioration and destruction of its grassland habitat (Taylor 2000b). Evidence suggests that the species was formerly much more widespread, although the high potential for confusion with the numerous Common Buttonquail, or any of the Coturnix quails makes the authenticity of some older records questionable. Brooke (1984) mentioned that this species was probably formerly a breeding summer visitor to plateaus of Free State province, and plotted a record from near Excelsior. Its occurrence in that province was not confirmed by subsequent atlas fieldwork (Earlé and Grobler 1987, Allan and Colahan 1997), but there is a recent SABAP2 record from the Golden Gate Highlands National Park area; further fieldwork is likely to reveal this buttonquail's presence in other parts of the eastern Free State. Likewise, its range in the former Transvaal appears to have contracted significantly. Tarboton et al. (1987) mention a specimen record as far north as Giyani, Limpopo and cite post-1979 sight records from Tzaneen and Serala (Wolkberg) in Limpopo, and Kangwane, Sabie, Malelane and Lower Sabie in Mpumalanga, all areas where this species has not been recorded recently. In KwaZulu-Natal there are historical breeding records from areas where suitable habitat no longer exists, e.g. Hillcrest (Tarboton 2001) and Pinetown (Clancey 1964); such records, together with the range outlined by Brooke (1984) suggest that the currently separated northern and southern populations were previously linked, and that the species also occurred further south in Eastern Cape. The regional population is thought to be in decline although the rate of decline is unknown. Confidence in this trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Generally elusive and difficult to flush, and adept at avoiding detection by creeping or running through grassy cover. Like other buttonquails, probably polyandrous, with the larger females vocalising to establish and maintain territories and attract males (Urban et al. 1986). Usually solitary or in pairs but may be encountered in loose aggregations (Urban et al. 1986), and under optimal conditions, several females may hold adjacent territories in a small area (Christian 2004). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The paucity of records makes movement patterns difficult to interpret and various theories have been proposed, although the species is probably nomadic over much of its range, arriving to breed during or towards the end of the rains and moving on when the habitat becomes unsuitable (Urban et al. 1986). In South Africa it breeds mainly from December to March (Dean 2005a). Although it is recorded virtually throughout the year (Cyrus and Robson 1980), records peak in mid- to late summer (Allan and Colahan 1997) when breeding activity is most intense. It is apparently absent from upland breeding sites in KwaZulu-Natal in the dry season (Taylor 2000b), while most records from the coastal plain are in winter and early summer (Robson and Horner 1996), possibly suggesting local altitudinal migration. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">However, like its congeners, it is most likely irruptive and nomadic, enabling it to exploit temporarily suitable habitats as determined by factors such as grazing levels, fires and rainfall. For example, the species is generally scarce in the Ozabeni section of iSimangaliso Wetland Park, Kwa&#173;Zulu-Natal, but was frequently encountered there for three years following Cyclone Demoina in 1984 (Robson and Horner 1996). Christian (2004) reported that it bred at two grassland sites that had been burned in the previous winter. At least when breeding, the species appears to prefer relatively short (20-50 cm high), sour grasslands with a tussocky structure and open ground between grass tufts to allow terrestrial mobility, both in Zimbabwe (Masterson 1973) and South Africa (Christian 2004); low basal cover may explain the absence of the species from grasslands with a profusion of forbs and creeping rather than tufted grasses (Christian 2004). It prefers flat or gently sloping ground, such as on plateaus and floodplains, as opposed to hillsides. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Although it avoids standing water and breeds in dry situations, it inhabits high-rainfall zones, and often occupies damp ground near depressions, dambos or watercourses, in Zimbabwe occurring on dark clay-type soils that become saturated during heavy rains (Masterson 1973). In South Africa the species may be encountered in dry, sparse Sporobolus grassland (Taylor 2000b), Themeda veld (Marchant 1988), moist Themeda/Tristachya/Trachypogon/Aristida grassland around coastal marshes, or short, sparse Eragrostis/Aristida/Hyparrhenia grassland with forbs such as Cyperus, Indigofera, Hypoxis and Eriosema present to a varying degree (Christian 2004). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Other reported habitats are scrubland with thin grass cover, fallow cultivation, irrigated short sugarcane and scrub and grass on old lands, in open or lightly wooded country (Maclean 1993, Clancey 1996, Allan and Colahan 1997). It may be attracted to short-grazed grass and ground disturbed by cattle (Urban et al. 1986), and occasionally forages along verges of vehicle tracks in grassland. Especially in South Africa, it may occur or even breed in close proximity to the Common Buttonquail (Taylor 2000b), but generally prefers moister habitats than the latter and there is little ecological overlap between the two (Irwin 1981). It occurs from sea-level up to 1 800 masl (Urban et al. 1986).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The threats faced by this species are shared with many other grassland specialists, and all threats contribute to deterioration and destruction of its grassland habitat: commercial afforestation, crop agriculture, stock farming and expanding rural and urban settlements (Allan and Colahan 1997), and on a local scale, mining operations and infrastructure development. Overly frequent burning is also considered a threat, but fires are probably an essential element to maintaining this species' preferred short and open-structured grassland habitat, and preventing development of a dense moribund layer at ground-level; biennial burning cycles may be most beneficial, but further research is needed. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The extent and quality of suitable habitat is likely to be reduced by infestation of forbs and exotic pioneer plants, trampling by livestock, grazing practices, agricultural activities, soil erosion and edge effects of increasing habitat fragmentation; the latter may influence local dispersal ability as well. The potential effects of drought and climate change should also be investigated. At sites near human settlements, localised threats may include disturbance from pedestrians, dogs, and ‘quad' bikes (Christian 2004), collisions with illuminated windows when flying at night, and predation by domestic and feral cats. It is unknown whether wing-shooting poses a significant threat, but there is a strong possibility that this species may be shot inadvertently while hunting the superficially similar Common Quail Coturnix coturnix, a highly prized quarry for both social and commercial wing-shooters in summer (Little 2012). The very similar Common Buttonquail may also be hunted occasionally. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In the globally Near Threatened Black-breasted Buttonquail T. melanogaster of eastern Australia, females are outnumbered by males and extirpation of even a small proportion of the population may thus lead to disproportionately skewed sex ratios and make populations vulnerable to genetic bottlenecks (Mathieson and Smith 2009); sex ratios have not been researched in the Black-rumped Buttonquail but may likewise be favoured to males given the presumed polyandrous breeding system (Urban et al. 1986, Tarboton 2001). In captivity the related Common Buttonquail exhibits remarkably high reproductive potential, with wild populations presumed to be curtailed by high mortality rate, lack of suitable climatic conditions for breeding, and shortage of potential mates of one sex (Urban et al. 1986). If similar factors counterbalance Black-rumped Buttonquail fecundity, significant population crashes may occur if total regional populations fall below critical levels. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation measures focusing on the Black-rumped Buttonquail are currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Brooke (1984), echoed by Allan and Colahan (1997) and Taylor (2000), urged that a survey is required to establish the status, distribution and habitat preferences before an adequate conservation programme can be planned and implemented (2013), and this is still the case. A national species recovery plan should be drawn up (see e.g. Mathieson and Smith 2009), with the involvement of conservation authorities, public-interest groups and land-owners, to: 1) investigate biological, ecological and demographic questions, 2) map and survey the historic, current and potential range, 3) develop an effective land-management strategy, 4) protect, expand and rehabilitate suitable habitat, 5) reduce or eliminate threats to the species and its habitat, and 6) establish a long-term monitoring programme. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Conserving a nomadic, erratic and wide-ranging species such as the Black-rumped Buttonquail appears to be, is challenging, and will require protection and effective management of large tracts of wilderness and smaller sites where breeding occurs, both in reserves and on private land. Two major key sites are probably uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park (SA IBA064) and iSimangaliso Wetland Park (SA IBA058), with the latter considered very important for the conservation of the species (Combrink and Kyle 2006). Taylor (2000) estimated that 20-56% of the regional population may occur in fully or partially protected IBAs. A re-assessment of the management practices and status of these IBAs should be executed. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Although this poses a considerable challenge, population surveys and habitat analyses should be prioritised, in order to re-assess the conservation status, prioritise sites for conservation, and identify suitable research locations. Furthermore, birdwatchers and land-owners should be encouraged to report any ad hoc sightings with supporting details to BirdLife South Africa and SABAP2. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In addition to conservation and recovery efforts of existing populations, a re-introduction programme is a viable option, as has been proposed for the Common Buttonquail in southern Europe (Pertoldi et al. 2006), which has been virtually extirpated from the Mediterranean region (Expósito et al. 2011). The reproductive potential of Common Buttonquails is high in captivity (Flieg 1973, Wintle 1975) and there are established husbandry practices (Spenkelink-Van Schaik 1984); captive-breeding potential is probably good for the Black-rumped Buttonquail as well (Brooke 1984). </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the Hottentot Buttonquail Turnix hottentottus, a range-restricted Fynbos endemic, is estimated to be less than1 000 mature individuals with an estimated continuing decline of 20% within two generations, with no sub-populations likely to exceed 250 mature individuals, satisfying criterion C1 and C2 and justifying the assessment of Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As a consequence of its recent recognition as specifically distinct from the more widespread Black-rumped Buttonquail Turnix nanus, the Hottentot Buttonquail is endemic to the region. It is currently listed as globally Endangered. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Previously considered conspecific with the Black-rumped Buttonquail T. nanus by many authorities (Dowsett and Dowsett-Lemaire 1993, Maclean 1993, del Hoyo et al. 1996). However, Sibley and Monroe (1990) suggested the two taxa are not conspecific; this taxonomic treatment is supported by their allopatric ranges and different habitat preferences and movement patterns (Dean 2005b), and subtle differences in plumage and bare parts colouration. Ryan and Hockey (1995) urged that a thorough reassessment of the taxonomic status is critical for any future conservation decisions. A split between hottentottus (s.s.) and nanus is currently accepted by BirdLife International (2014w), BirdLife South Africa (Lotz 2015) and the International Ornithologists' Union (Gill and Donsker 2015). </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">14-15 cm, 40-60 g. Sexes differ in colour of bare parts and plumage. Male drab and straw-coloured, with profuse streaking and barring above. Below pale rufous, heavily spotted with black on breast and flanks. Female more richly coloured, with slate-grey remiges contrasting with rich buffy wing coverts, rufous face and bright orange-rufous breast. Legs and feet chrome-yellow. Bill horn-coloured with paler lower mandible. Eyes yellow. Lacks the conspicuously darker rump of Black-rumped Buttonquail (Ryan and Hockey 1995, Dean 2005b, Lee 2013).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Hottentot Buttonquail is mostly restricted to the Fynbos Biome in Western Cape. It occurs from Cape Point (Table Mountain National Park), eastwards throughout the Cape Fold Mountains, with records from Hottentots Holland and adjacent ranges (e.g. near Somerset West, Kogelberg, Kleinmond and the Limietberg-Bain's Kloof areas; Taylor 2000b). It is also known from the Langeberg and Overberg regions (Bontebok National Park, De Hoop Nature Reserve, Potberg, Malgas and Wydgelee; Ryan and Hockey 1995). In the east of its range, it extends eastwards to the border of Eastern Cape along the Outeniqua, Kamanassie, Gamkasberg and Kouga ranges (Lee 2013). It was previously recorded as far east as Addo Elephant Park and Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape (Grobler and Braack 1984) although there have been no recent records from this area (Allan and Colahan 1997). It also occurs in Strandveld along the West Coast, with occasional reports near Langebaan, and has been found breeding in Renosterveld near Melkbosstrand (Ryan and Hockey 1995). An earlier record from Graafwater near Lambert's Bay was in error (Ryan and Hockey 1995). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species may be the most thinly distributed of South Africa's endemics and one of the least frequently recorded resident and breeding terrestrial birds in general (Lee 2013). Being so widely overlooked, the true extent of its distribution is unknown and future surveys are likely to reveal its presence in additional localities. The range of this taxon was estimated to be less than500 km2 by Taylor (2000), and SABAP2 data suggest an AoO of c. 1 600 km2. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size is unknown. Brooke (1984) considered the species on the brink of extinction, while Hockey et al. (1989) described it as rare and highly localised but speculated that it may be common in remote mountainous areas. A survey by Ryan and Hockey (1995) in the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve (Table Mountain National Park) showed that the area may hold 350 (100-560) birds, occurring at 1 bird/5 ha in 25 km2 of suitable restionaceous Fynbos habitats, and making it the joint third most common bird species in such vegetation types. However, this census may represent an overestimate (Fraser 2014). Sampling method and time elapsed since the vegetation was last burnt influence population estimates, e.g. Fraser (1990) reported a density of only 1 bird/250 ha in similar habitat greater than 15 years after a fire. Densities in coastal Renosterveld are estimated at 1 bird/28-44 ha (Winterbottom 1968b). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Taylor (2000) roughly estimated the global and regional population at less than1 200 birds, but conservative extrapolations from the lower density estimates calculated by Fraser (1990) suggest a total population of only 400 individuals (Lee 2013). A precautionary estimate lies within the band 250-999 mature individuals, with no more than 250 individuals in the largest sub-population (BirdLife International 2014w). Confidence in this population estimate is low and requires verification.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population is suspected to undergoing a decline owing to on-going habitat loss and degradation (Taylor 2000b).</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Usually solitary but may be encountered in pairs during the early to mid-summer breeding season (Lee 2013). Generally unobtrusive, quiet and difficult to flush, with cryptic habits and plumage, and consequently it is easily overlooked. In addition, its voice is poorly described, with a hooting call, presumably from the female, being variously described as similar to that of co-occurring Striped Flufftail Sarothrura affinis (Lockhart 1998), or nearly indistinguishable from Black-rumped Buttonquail (Lee 2013). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">It occurs in restio-dominated Fynbos, in both coastal and mountain localities, on flat to fairly steeply sloping ground, reaching its highest densities in short (20-40 cm high) Restionaceous Plateau Fynbos, typically in areas that were burnt within the previous 4-5 years (Ryan and Hockey 1995). This vegetation type recovers rapidly after fire, attaining almost complete regrowth of at least shorter restioid elements within a few years after a fire (Fraser 1990). Even in Fynbos that was burnt 12-15 years previously, Lee (2013) confirmed the Hottentot Buttonquail's preference for sparse vegetation cover dominated by restios, in this case with prevailing 1 m high Protea lorifolia on drier and hotter north-east facing slopes in the Kouga Mountains. However, at Helderberg Nature Reserve, Somerset West, the species was also reported from taller proteoid Fynbos (Ryan and Hockey 1995), and may occur alongside Striped Flufftail in such low, dense thickets (Taylor 2000b). It is also known to utilise old farmlands adjacent to Fynbos. It occurs sparsely in coastal Renosterveld and Strandveld along the West Coast. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">It is considered resident and possibly sedentary (Allan and Colahan 1997), but the irregularity of sightings within and between years may imply that it is locally nomadic (Dean 2005b), probably depending on occurrence of fires and consequently vegetation density, and rainfall (Fraser 2014). Nocturnal movement between habitat patches is suggested by a bird flying into a window at Betty's Bay at night (Blackshaw and Blackshaw 1998). The Hottentot Buttonquail is probably territorial and polyandrous (Dean 2005b), with nesting taking place between September and December, but mainly in October (Winterbottom 1968a, Tarboton 2011). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A relatively high proportion of the favoured Mountain Fynbos vegetation inhabited by this species is under formal conservation (Low and Rebelo 1996, Barnes 1998), although commercial afforestation and invasion by alien woody shrubs pose serious threats (Ryan and Hockey 1995). While the Fynbos habitat of this species is naturally adapted to fire, inappropriate burning frequencies and intensities in lowland areas may still constitute a threat. Populations in coastal Strandveld are probably under greater pressure due to rapid urban development and agricultural expansion (Taylor 2000b). The potential effects of climate change on this species have not been fully investigated, but may constitute a considerable cause for concern, given the Hottentot Buttonquail's naturally restricted range, mountain habitats and reliance on the Fynbos Biome (Simmons et al. 2004). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures are currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Lee (2013) considered this species to be the South African endemic most deserving of a focused investigation into its conservation status. A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Surveys are required to establish the abundance, distribution and precise habitat requirements of this species, before adequate conservation actions can be planned, as urged by Taylor (2000). Given that the species is highly sought-after by birdwatchers, organising controlled synchronised surveys by a large number of observers is a potentially effective method of surveying suitable habitats, and simultaneously raising funds and awareness, as has been done for the White-winged Flufftail Sarothrura ayresi. Mountaineers, hikers, land-owners and conservation officials should be encouraged to report any ad hoc sightings with supporting details to BirdLife South Africa and SABAP2. The species is poorly represented in reference and genetic collections, and specimens found dead should be donated to museums or other research institutions.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the near-endemic Bank Cormorant Phalacrocorax neglectus satisfies the population size decrease criterion A2 for Endangered (an observed, estimated, inferred, or suspected decrease in population size of =50% over the past three generations, where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible). In addition, it is suspected that this decline will continue into the future satisfying criteria A3 and A4.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution occurs within the region. In addition, the species is currently listed as globally Endangered and was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">75-76 cm; 1.8-2.1 kg. Sexes alike in plumage colouration. A heavily built, large cormorant, with a distinctive, peaked forecrown. Adult breeding plumage is entirely black, apart from white rump patch. Feathers of head and body glossed greenish, while the scapulars, wing coverts and feathers of the upper mantle have a bronze iridescence. Bill dark grey-black; eye-ring, bare gular pouch, legs and feet black. Juveniles entirely black, without iridescence. Eyes are unique in having bi-coloured halves: pale brown on the top half and blue on the lower half (Crawford and Cooper 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is near-endemic to the region, being restricted to the cold waters of the Benguela Current off the West Coast of South Africa and Namibia. It breeds at 45 different locations from Hoanib River mouth, Namibia, to Quoin Rock, South Africa (Crawford and Cooper 2005). Colonies of Bank Cormorants are present at five Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in the region, namely Dassen Island, Dyer Island Nature Reserve, Overstrand, Robben Island National Heritage Monument, and West Coast National Park and Saldanha Bay Islands.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population was estimated to be c. 5 600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014x) while Crawford et al. (2012a) estimated the regional population at c. 470 pairs (1 410-1 880 individuals). Confidence in the regional population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In 1978, the regional population was 1 506 pairs, equating to 4 518-6 024 mature individuals (Cooper 1981), decreasing by 68.8% to 470 pairs (or 1 410-1 880 mature individuals) in 2011. Counts were incomplete in 1989, but between 1990 and 2011 (22 years, i.e. 3 generations before 2011), the population decreased by 56.9% at the eight main breeding islands. To account for short-term, natural, inter-annual variation in numbers, counts for 1991 were calculated as the average over a 3-year period (1990-1992: 551 pairs) and bird counts for 2011 were also calculated as the average over a 3-year period (2009-2011: 244 pairs; Crawford et al. 2012a). Confidence in the regional population trend is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Bank Cormorants are found on the coast and at sea mainly in inshore waters (less than10 km), breeding mainly on islands and islets and on rocky outcrops of the mainland, where they build elevated nests. Using data for related species, Crawford and Shelton (1981) assumed an age at breeding of four years for Bank Cormorants and an annual survival rate of 0.8 for adults. A survival rate of 0.8 gives a life expectancy for breeding birds of 3.45 years and hence a generation length of about 7.45 years, although it should be noted that adult survival has never been estimated for this species and 0.8 is inferred from other similar-sized species (Crawford et al. 1999). Similarly, age at first breeding was estimated at three years (Crawford et al. 2001). Bank Cormorants forage benthically over inshore kelp beds, clear rocky or sandy substrate, mainly on West Coast Rock Lobster Jasus lalandii and benthic fish of the Clinidae family (Crawford and Cooper 2005).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is vulnerable to oiling, as it depends on the inshore zone and forests of kelp beds to forage, and these are often directly affected by oil spills. In addition to oiling, it is sensitive to human disturbance and will abandon its nest when approached, leaving the contents to be depredated by Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus (Cooper 1987). Bank Cormorants could be limited by the availability of nesting habitat and may be out-competed by Cape Fur Seals Arctocephalus pusillus who use the same type of habitat for hauling out or breeding (Crawford et al. 1999).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A link between numbers of breeding pairs at any colony and local estimates of available West Coast Rock Lobster suggests that local reductions in lobster density (either due to human fisheries or environmental forcing, or both) could be driving the decline in the Bank Cormorant population (Crawford et al. 2008a). However, this does not fully explain the decrease, because numbers have continued to decline at colonies inside no-take reserves where lobster is plentiful. In South Africa, Bank Cormorants are winter breeders. Due to their habit of breeding close to shorelines, their breeding success can be negatively affected by large winter storms, which can wipe out nests (Sherley et al. 2012). An increase in frequency and amplitude of these events due to climate change, would have a strong impact on future breeding success of Bank Cormorants. Similarly, Bank Cormorant chicks are suspected to be highly sensitive to heat waves (higher mortality) and such events may be set to increase, owing to climate change (Sherley et al. 2012). An increase in rainfall would also increase chick mortality through flooding of nests or hypothermia.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is protected in terms of the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act No. 46 of 1973. Current conservation actions involve only full protection of breeding colonies of Bank Cormorants, i.e. mainly islands, which fall under the jurisdiction of South African National Parks, CapeNature, and Robben Island Nature Reserve, as well as the mainland colony at Betty's Bay which is managed jointly by CapeNature and Overstrand Municipality. The capacity to hand-rear Bank Cormorants from eggs is being developed by Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds, in case the population needs to be bolstered in future.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. In the eventuality that rock lobster is shown to be a primary driver of population dynamics, full protection of rock lobsters should be considered around every island or mainland colony where Bank Cormorants breed. Efforts should be made to census the entire South African population annually so that trends can be assessed more accurately. Increased public awareness of the conservation problems facing this species is needed, particularly in terms of its sensitivity to human disturbance and reliance on rock lobsters for food. Efforts to reduce illegal cleaning of oil tanks at sea and to ensure complete salvage of oil from ships wrecked around breeding colonies would benefit this species (BirdLife International 2014x). Bank Cormorants can breed successfully on man-made structures (Sherley et al. 2012) and providing additional, protected, artificial breeding opportunities may be necessary in the future. The ease of human access to nests at Robben Island is a concern and such disturbance almost certainly causes breeding failures. Immediate action to prevent what is technically illegal access should be taken by the Robben Island Museum authorities.</p>

	<h3>Research priorities and questions</h3>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US">Research is under way at Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology and the Animal Demography Unit. This involves mainly the testing of the food-shortage and heat-stress hypotheses for the decline of Bank Cormorant numbers. Abundance of West Coast Rock Lobster Jasus lalandii, a prey animal identified as an important component of Bank Cormorant diet, is suspected to drive part of the population dynamics in South Africa. A modelling approach (using bird counts on the one hand and biomass estimates of rock lobster on the other; both provided by Ocean and Coasts, Department of Environmental Affairs) will test this hypothesis. The hypothesis that global climate change and heat-stress are aggravating factors in the decline is also being tested through a series of field experiments using cameras and temperature loggers deployed in the field. </p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US">Bank Cormorants are also the focus of ongoing research into regime shifts in the inshore environment being conducted by the Marine Research Institute at University of Cape Town.</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span> Future research should focus on using a modelling approach that will test a suite of environmental variables (air temperature, sea-surface temperature, rainfall, wind), as well as biological variables, like seal abundance (a potential competitor) or abundance of other benthic organisms (plant or animal).</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span> Gaining further information on basic demographic parameters, particularly adult and juvenile survival, and how these respond to environmental variability should also be given priority. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The previously abundant Cape Cormorant Phalacrocorax capensis now satisfies the population size criterion A2 for regionally Endangered (an observed, estimated, inferred, or suspected population size reduction of =50% over the last three generations where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible). In addition, it is suspected that this decline will continue into the future satisfying criteria A3 and A4.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of the Cape Cormorant falls within the region. In addition, the species is currently listed as globally Near Threatened and was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">61-64 cm; 1.1-1.3 kg. A medium-sized, dark, marine cormorant, often seen flying low over the ocean in long lines. Sexes alike in plumage coloration. Breeding adult plumage overall blue-black with glossy sheen; variable number of white filoplumes on head, neck and vent. Wing coverts and scapulars iridescent bronze-green, with narrow black edges and shafts. Flight feathers black. Bill dark grey-black. Eyes turquoise; eye-ring greenish, with bright blue ‘beads' early in breeding season. Bare skin below eye, at base of lower mandible, and on gular pouch deep yellow-orange. Legs and feet black. Non-breeding adult duller, with throat and breast often mottled brown; eyes duller turquoise and facial skin and gular pouch duller yellow. Immature duller and paler still, with throat and breast brown or cream. Scapulars, mantle and wing coverts brown, with dark green and blue-black sheen. Eyes blue-grey; eye-ring lacks beads. Bare facial skin and gular pouch pale yellow, with traces of black and white. Juvenile as immature but browner and paler; head and neck sometimes appear slightly downy. Entire underparts pale brown. Eyes grey. Gular pouch black, white or speckled (Crawford 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Cape Cormorant is endemic to southern Africa, occurring from Lobito, central Angola, to Maputo Bay, southern Mozambique with its core range being from Cape Cross, northern Namibia to Cape Agulhas, Western Cape (Cooper et al. 1982). Its breeding range extends from Ilha dos Tigres, southern Angola to Bird Island, Eastern Cape (Crawford 1997a). It is a regular visitor to the coasts of KwaZulu-Natal, mainly between July and November and is a winter visitor to southern Angola (Brooke 1981).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at c. 144 000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014y). In 2011, the regional population comprised of 74 816 mature individuals compared to 106 479 pairs or 213 000 breeding birds in 1978 (Crawford et al. 2012a). The confidence in this regional population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population is in decline. Between 1985 and 2011 (26 years, i.e. 3 generations before 2011), the population decreased by 57.4% at the six main breeding islands. To account for short-term natural inter-annual variation in numbers, bird counts for 1985 were calculated as the average over a 4 year period (1985-1988: 155 392 mature individuals) and bird counts for 2011 were also calculated as the average over a 4 year period (2008-2011: 66 242 mature individuals; Crawford et al. 2012a). The regional population is suspected to be declining in excess of the 50% threshold and this decline will continue. The confidence in this regional population trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Cape Cormorant is found on the coast and at sea mainly in inshore waters, but also offshore (less than50 km from the coast). It breeds mainly on islands and islets, but also on rocky outcrops of the mainland, including cliffs or boulders (Crawford 2005a). Forages at sea on small pelagic fish, mainly on Cape Anchovy Engraulis encrasicolis, South African Sardine Sardinops sagax and Horse Mackerel Trachurus trachurus (Crawford and Dyer 1995). A generation length of 8.7 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014y) although Crawford et al. (2001) provided a lower generation length of 7 years.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The number of breeding pairs at any time has been shown to depend directly on available food biomass, and in particular anchovies and sardines. Prey biomass is known to fluctuate from year to year and the sardine population has undertaken an eastward shift in the 2000s, possibly due to climate change. This shift may explain some of the decline observed on the West Coast (Crawford et al. 2007b). Depletion of local resources by purse-seine fisheries is also thought to be partly responsible for the negative trends observed, particularly over a longer period and mainly for colonies on the West Coast; this hypothesis requires further investigation. The species is very sensitive to human disturbance, which leads to nest desertion and loss of eggs and chicks to avian predators. The increase in numbers of Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus may decrease the breeding success in some areas through increased predation on eggs and chicks (Voorbergen et al. 2012). Great White Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus are a threat on islands off the West Coast, predating large amounts of average to large size chicks (Mwema et al. 2010). A serious threat is the Cape Fur Seal Arctocephalus pusillus, which can predate up to 24% of all fledglings produced by a single breeding colony (Voorbergen et al. 2012) and which are increasing in numbers. Worryingly, about 65% of the South African population breeds at just one locality, Dyer Island, where large outbreaks of avian cholera Pasteurella multocida caused substantial mortality of Cape Cormorants in the early 2000s (Waller and Underhill 2007). Avian cholera also caused mortalities at Dassen Island and Lambert's Bay. The species is vulnerable to oiling, and attempts to catch and clean oiled birds have generally been unsuccessful in the past.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Current conservation actions involve only full protection of breeding colonies of Cape Cormorants, i.e. mainly islands, which fall under the jurisdiction of South African National Parks, CapeNature and Robben Island Nature Reserve. Trends in numbers breeding at important colonies are being monitored by Department of Environmental Affairs, CapeNature and SANParks. Opportunistic information on diet is obtained. Banding of chicks is undertaken to estimate movements and survival. The species is protected in terms of the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act No. 46 of 1973.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Conservation research should focus more specifically on investigating and efficiently addressing the food shortage hypothesis. Although fishing is suspected to be partly responsible for the decline of Cape Cormorant numbers, this remains difficult to demonstrate. Future research should concentrate on exploring how different indexes of fish abundance, including catch biomass, at different geographical and temporal scales influence population dynamics at different colonies. It is important that food is secured in the vicinity of important colonies, especially Dyer Island, and that spread of disease continues to be restricted. This work should link explicitly to similar work, for similar objectives, being undertaken for other threatened near-endemic colonial seabird species, such as the African Penguin Spheniscus demersus and Cape Gannet Morus capensis.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Grey Crowned Crane Balearica regulorum has undergone a continuous decline of greater than 30% over the past 45 years (three generation period) satisfying the criterion for regionally Vulnerable. The key threats to the species are still present and in many cases are escalating in scale. The species is however listed as globally Endangered and the global status is also adopted as the regional status.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the species' distribution occurs within the region. In addition, the Grey Crowned Crane was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and globally Endangered in 2012.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The crowned cranes are the most ancient of all cranes, pre-dating other crane species by tens of millions of years. It appears that the Balearica lineage diverged from the Gruinea lineage between 31 and 37 million years ago, and through phylogenetic analyses (Krajewski et al. 2010) and biochemical systematics, the well-established, reciprocal monophyly of the clades Balearicinae (crowned cranes) and Gruinea (anatomically derived cranes), is confirmed. Two subspecies of Grey Crowned Crane are recognised, namely the South African nominate Balearica regulorum regulorum and the East African B. r. gibbericeps (Meine and Archibald 1996); the ranges of these two taxa are separated by the Zambezi River (Beilfuss et al. 2007). Forms a  superspecies with the Black Crowned Crane B. pavonina (Urban et al. 1986).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">106 cm, 3.5 kg. A large, spectacular and unmistakable species. Sexes alike, but males larger. Body mainly grey. Wing coverts white, with golden inner coverts. Primaries black; secondaries chestnut. Head adorned with ornamental crown of stiff golden feathers. Cheek patches white, contrasting with bare red gular sack and black forehead and throat. Legs, toes and bill dark grey. Juveniles are generally greyish, with the upper body feathers edged rufous, and the lower body feathers sandy buff. Nape is brown, face is feathered and buffy, and crown is spiky and golden buff (Allan 2005c).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The range of the Grey Crowned Crane stretches from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Kenya to south-eastern South Africa (Walkinshaw 1964). The South African subspecies occurs in Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa (Allan 1997a). Within the region, the range of the species is divided between three core areas: the Eastern Cape and Transkei area; KwaZulu-Natal; and eastern Free State (van Niekerk 2011). Atlas records do not indicate occurrence in Lesotho with birds recorded there being considered non-breeding vagrants (Osborne and Tigar 1990). The EoO of the species has declined by 28.74% between the two atlasing periods while the AoO has declined by 24.24% from 174 642 km2 to 132 310 km2. The species is well represented in the regional IBA network. Grey Crowned Cranes are non-migratory, but undertake variable local and seasonal movements (Morrison and Bothma 1998).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population was quantified at 50 000-64 000 individuals in 2004 (Beilfuss et al. 2007) with the East African population gibbericeps making up the majority of the global population (Meine and Archibald 1996). The South African subspecies appeared to be relatively stable with 3 500 individuals counted in the 2001 National Crane Census (2003), and an estimated population of greater than 4 000 present in the country (Beilfuss et al. 2007). Confidence in this population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is in decline with the species experiencing a steady, long-term decline across much of its range (Beilfuss et al. 2007). The East African gibbericeps has declined significantly within its range where status surveys have been conducted. Regionally, the nominate subspecies has experienced declines of greater than 30% in the past three generations (45 years), noted by McCann and Wilkins (1995) who estimated a 15% decline in the KwaZulu-Natal population between 1982 and 1994. Comparing reporting rates from SABAP1 and SABAP2, the data indicate that Grey Crowned Cranes have declined over the two reporting periods, i.e. 1987-2015 with reporting rates in Mpumalanga/north-eastern Free State and north-western KwaZulu-Natal being lower during SABAP2 than SABAP1 and the species apparently no longer occurs in some grid cells in which it was reported in SABAP1. This indicates that the cranes are less frequently reported and infers that populations in this region have declined or that birds have moved away from existing or known breeding and feeding sites. The regional population is suspected to be undergoing a continuous decline of greater than 30% over three generations. The confidence in this population trend is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Grey Crowned Cranes require mixed wetland-grassland habitats (Filmer and Holtshausen 1992). They typically nest within or on the edges of wetlands, while foraging in wetlands, nearby grasslands, and croplands (Morrison and Bothma 1998). Non-breeders roost communally at night in trees or on overhead utility structures while breeding pairs roost on the ground, in wetlands at the nest (Morrison and Bothma 1998). A generation length of 15 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014z). Foraging takes place in short to medium height open grassland, lightly wooded savannah and agricultural fields (Pomeroy 1980). Cultivated lands play an important role with 56% of records of Grey Crowned Cranes in cultivated lands, 7% of which were maize fields (van Niekerk 2011), with birds in East Africa causing considerable damages to crops (Pomeroy 1980).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to the species in South Africa is the widespread degradation and loss of breeding habitats, most often caused by the draining or damming of wetlands (Johnson and Barnes 1986, McCann and Wilkins 1995, McCann 2003). In the future, open-cast coal mining will most likely significantly impact upon habitat availability within Mpumalanga grasslands. Birds utilise agricultural lands extensively and intensively, particularly when flocking in winter and into spring (van Niekerk 2011). Damage on maize lands occurs within the first 2-3 weeks of planting when the plants and seeds are easy to extract (van Niekerk 2011). The crane's presence in agricultural lands, and the real or perceived damage they cause, often brings them into conflict with farmers, increasing the risk of persecution through poisoning or shooting (Johnson and Barnes 1986, McCann 2003). Illegal removal of chicks from the wild for illegal trade is a significant threat to the species in Africa, including South Africa (McCann and Wilkins 1995, Morrison et al. 2007a). The majority of chicks taken are destined for the zoo and pet trade, and are seldom kept for eating. In the illegal trade, chicks taken from the wild are often legalised through legal pairs or birds that traders have on permit. Power-lines pose a collision hazard to young, inexperienced birds and adults on misty days, and transformer boxes pose an electrocution risk when cranes attempt to roost (Martin and Shaw 2010). Other threats include disturbance at nesting areas, entanglement in fences, collision with other overhead lines and hunting by dogs, coordinated or not (Beilfuss et al. 2007).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Endangered Wildlife Trust's African Crane Conservation Programme has full-time Field Officers covering the greater part of Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal Midlands and southern KwaZulu-Natal. Conservation efforts in these areas include monitoring, securing key sites through the National Biodiversity Stewardship Programme, and proactive involvement in development applications at key crane sites. The Endangered Wildlife Trust's Wildlife and Energy Programme works closely with Eskom to proactively reduce the potential of power-line collisions and electrocutions, and to reactively mitigate high-risk power-lines. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Grey Crowned Cranes opportunistically forage in agricultural lands and come into conflict with land-owners during the germination phase of maize and other crops. A study was recently completed on the damage caused by Grey Crowned Cranes on maize in Eastern Cape, investigating methods of quantifying crop damage and influence of seed treatments to control insect pests (van Niekerk 2011). The Endangered Wildlife Trust is currently exploring the registration of a crop deterrent that has been used effectively in USA by the International Crane Foundation to deter Sandhill Cranes Grus canadensis from eating germinating crops. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The International Crane Foundation/Endangered Wildlife Trust Partnership is currently addressing the illegal trade through the African Crane Trade Project. This project works at the supply side of the market where cranes are removed from the wild, on the compliance and legislative areas, and with the demand sector both in Africa and internationally. Notably, Grey Crowned Cranes have been included in the CITES Significant Trade Review process and are currently under review. The Grey Crowned Crane is currently included in a Biodiversity Management Plan for Species being developed for all three crane species in South Africa.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ongoing maintenance of all Endangered Wildlife Trust projects that involve the conservation of the Grey Crowned Crane, including the Crane Conservation Programme, Wildlife and Energy Programme, and African Crane Trade Project, in partnership with the International Crane Foundation, is essential. An improved understanding of the habitat characteristics of wetlands that Grey Crowned Cranes use for nesting is important and is a possible research topic.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the majestic Martial Eagle Polemaetus bellicosus is estimated at c. 800 mature individuals and is believed to be undergoing a continuous population decline of greater than 20% over a period of two generations. In addition, there appears to have been a suspected population size reduction of greater than 30% over the last three generations where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible. For these reasons, it is listed as regionally Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global range occurs within the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Near Threatened. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">78-83 cm, 3.3-4.7 kg. A large, powerful eagle. Sexes are similar, but females are considerably larger and on average darker above and more profusely spotted below. Adults can be identified by their large size, together with completely dark brown upperparts, throat, neck, and head, contrasting with the white, lightly spotted breast, belly and remainder of underparts. At all ages, the head has a small crest. In flight appears massive, with the undersides of the remiges looking dark and closely barred. The underwing coverts are dark brown to blackish. The tail has heavy barring, most obvious from below. In adults the eyes are bright yellow, the bill is black with a grey cere, and the feet are bluish grey to pale yellow with dark talons. Juveniles differ from adults in having the upperparts dark grey, with pale-edged feathers, while the underparts are whitish with pale grey markings on the side of the chest. The head is pale grey with a white crown and a slightly shorter crest than adult's. The undersides of the remiges are slightly paler grey, while the underwing coverts are almost entirely white. Tail is lightly barred. Eyes are dark brown, bill is black with a grey-greenish cere, and feet are greenish (Simmons 2005c).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Martial Eagle is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, only being absent from the lowland forests of West Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). With the exception of Lesotho, the species is widespread in the region but is more commonly encountered in protected areas such as in the Lowveld and Kalahari (Barnes 2000c). Two conservation areas, the Kruger National Park and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, together hold a substantial proportion of the region's population. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Outside of protected areas in the former Transvaal, Martial Eagle territory sizes are on average between 300 and 1 000 km2 in extent; however, such territory sizes are probably not natural, and may be attributable to persecution and human-induced alteration of primary productivity (van Zyl 1992). In more natural situations, Martial Eagles still require an exceptionally large home range, in excess of 130 km2 (Brown et al. 1982). Densities in areas stocked with indigenous game are higher than in areas supporting only domestic stock, and the species is virtually absent from cultivated areas (Machange et al. 2005). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Breeding adults are thought to be sedentary; juveniles and immature birds, however, wander widely from their natal areas (Simmons 2005c). The recent SABAP2 maps indicate a decrease in EoO (13.99%) while the AoO estimates show an alarming decrease of 53.47% indicating that it has not been detected in more than half of its former range. The pressure that this species is facing outside of the large protected areas is even more dramatic with reporting rates from the SABAP2 project showing large decreases or even absence from large areas of their former range. According to Parker (1999) it is scarce in neighbouring Sul do Save, southern Mozambique.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been estimated (BirdLife International 2014aa) although tens of thousands seems probable (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Despite this large population size, the Martial Eagle is threatened across its range and has experienced a decline in population numbers within the region (Boshoff 1997a), as well as outside the region, with declines reported in Namibia (Brown 1991b), southern Mozambique (Parker 1999), and possibly Zimbabwe. No regional population estimate currently exists. Figures from 1982 suggested approximately 300 mature individuals occurred in Western, Eastern and Northern Cape provinces combined (Brooke 1984). However, a survey of a single electricity pylon line of 1 400 km in the central and south-western Karoo by Machange et al. (2005) estimated 34 active Martial Eagle territories indicating that the estimate provided by Brooke (1984) was more than likely an underestimate. Although Tarboton and Allan (1984) suggested 1 000 mature individuals occurred in the former Transvaal, with 137 pairs in Kruger National Park, numbers must be much less than this today. Murn et al. (2012) estimated a breeding population of 110 mature individuals in the Kruger National Park based upon their 2011 aerial survey of nests, a decrease of at least 50%. In 1994, the Swaziland total was estimated at 40 mature individuals (Parker 1994) while more recently Monadjem and Rasmussen (2008) estimated that there were 14 mature individuals within protected areas in Swaziland representing a decline of greater than 50%. In summary, Brooke (1984) suggested a total regional population of less than2 000 mature individuals while Barnes (2000d) estimated there to be less than1 200 mature individuals in the region. Taking into account historical as well as reported decreases, the present regional population is estimated be c. 800 mature individuals. The confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is difficult to quantify but is suspected to have undergone a moderately rapid decline over the past 56 years (BirdLife International 2014aa). Lower reporting rates outside protected and sparsely inhabited areas suggest a dramatic decrease in densities throughout the region. Worryingly, reporting rates for large protected areas, such as Kruger National Park, also show a large decrease. The large number of checklists available for pentads in these areas means that the differences in protocol between SABAP1 and SABAP2 cannot be responsible for the consistent decrease in reporting rates. Based upon this, the decline seen in past years is probably ongoing and is believed to have been greater than 40% over the past three generations (56 years). This reduction in population size has not ceased and may not be reversible. The confidence in this regional population trend estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Martial Eagles occur in a variety of habitats but seem to prefer arid and mesic savannah but are also commonly found at forest edges and in open shrubland (Simmons 2005c). Birds will occupy most habitats provided there are adequate tall trees or pylons for nesting and perching (Machange et al. 2005). It rarely occurs in mountainous areas. It is known to nest on human-made structures, such as pylons and wind-pumps, and in alien trees (Tarboton and Allan 1984). The ability to nest on such structures may have increased densities in naturally treeless parts of the Karoo, Namaqualand and Kalahari (Machange et al. 2005). In extensive areas of good natural habitat, such as the Kruger National Park (Kemp and Kemp 1974), immatures are uncommon while adults and juveniles are seen regularly (Kemp and Begg 2001), suggesting that breeding pairs dominate the best habitats and immatures have to disperse elsewhere to mature. Declining sightings in the Kruger National Park suggests that adult recruitment may be falling because dispersal areas for immatures have become population sinks with reduced survival and therefore falling recruitment. The generation length of 18.5 years was calculated based on a published estimate of mean age at first breeding and extrapolated maximum longevity in the wild (BirdLife International 2014aa).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Martial Eagle was probably the most severely persecuted raptor in the former Cape Province (Boshoff et al. 1983). Barnes (2000d) attributes the main causes for the decline in numbers to activities which occurred outside of the protected areas, with the main causes being direct persecution (shooting and trapping) by small-stock farmers, indirect persecution by poisoning, drowning in sheer-walled farm reservoirs, reduction of natural prey through habitat alteration and degradation, nest site disturbance and electrocution on electricity pylons. Monadjem and Rasmussen (2008) suspected that eaglets in Swaziland, outside of protected areas, are removed from their nests and sold to traditional healers for medicinal purposes. The process of rangeland modification and degradation (primarily by overgrazing) affects eagle populations, at least indirectly by influencing the distribution, abundance, and accessibility of prey (Machange et al. 2005). Habitat transformation is only likely to increase and as a result this species may become even more restricted to large protected areas in the future.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Martial Eagle is listed as Vulnerable under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004) and under the Swaziland Game Act of 1991. The species is the focus of a range of projects and initiatives of the Endangered Wildlife Trust's Birds of Prey Programme. The Kalahari Raptor Project has used the species as one of its flagship species in creating greater awareness for the need to conserve this and other raptors in the southern Kalahari for almost 25 years. The Platberg Karoo Raptor Project has fulfilled the same function in the Eastern Karoo since 2002. The Northern Cape Raptor Conservation Forum acknowledges land-owners who have active nests of this species on their property and provides information on how to conserve such sites to the benefit of the birds. Regular surveys are undertaken of pairs nesting on infrastructure associated with transmission power-lines and cell-phone towers in the Karoo. Data of nesting sites throughout the species' range is used to advise Eskom concerning the routing of power-lines via the Endangered Wildlife Trust's Wildlife Energy Programme. The Lowveld/Kruger National Park Large Bird Project includes this species in its annual aerial survey of the Kruger National Park and is in the process of obtaining a reliable estimate of the breeding population of this species in the Lowveld. So far, these initiatives seem inadequate to reverse the population decline. The Martial Eagle is listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No 7 of 2003. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Conservation interventions required include adequately enforcing protection of breeding sites outside of the protected area network via land-use agreements. Regular monitoring of the species is required in order to more accurately determine the regional population and conservation status. Implementation of an awareness programme involving land-owners and local communities to highlight the threats facing this species is recommended.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Tawny Eagle Aquila rapax appears to have decreased at a rate greater than 50% over three generations, satisfying the thresholds for regionally Endangered under criterion A2. In addition, the regional population of less than1 000 birds is estimated to be undergoing a continuous decline estimated to be greater than 20% in two generations, satisfying the population criterion C1 for regionally Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this species occurs within the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Globally, three subspecies of Tawny Eagle are recognised: A. r. vindhiana in Pakistan and India; A. r. belisarius in North Africa, Arabia and tropical Africa; and the nominate A. r. rapax in south Kenya and southern Africa (Sibley and Monroe 1990). The Tawny Eagle has on occasion been lumped with the Steppe Eagle Aquila nipalensis, but they differ in immature plumage, morphology and genetics (Clark 1992, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">65-77 cm; 1.6-2.4 kg. Sexes are similar, but the female is larger and often darker and more heavily marked. The plumage is extremely variable in overall colour and intensity of markings, ranging from ‘blonde' to dark brown. Most birds in southern Africa are tan or rufous brown. The undersides of the remiges are greyish and lightly barred. The tail is fairly long and rounded, often with light barring. The bill is dark grey, with a yellow cere and gape. Toes are yellow and the talons dark. Eyes become yellow after about two years. Juveniles differ subtly from adults in being generally paler and less marked, having whitish uppertail coverts which may form an indistinct pale patch, and having pale tips to the inner primaries and secondaries, as well as initially dark brown eyes (Simmons 2005d). Field identification of brown eagles is notoriously difficult, and despite vetting efforts, a certain degree of error may be present in datasets.</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Tawny Eagle is widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In southern Africa, it is largely concentrated in protected areas in the north-east and central parts of the region (Simmons 1997b), which is confirmed by more recent SABAP2 data. The species is well represented in the IBA network, with Kruger National Park having the highest reporting rates, followed by Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in Northern Cape and the northern KwaZulu-Natal parks of Ndumo, Mkuze, Hluhluwe-iMfolozi and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Outside of protected areas, the Tawny Eagle has disappeared from large parts of its former range, with reporting rates being substantially lower in SABAP2 than in SABAP1, or with the species now completely absent from certain grid cells. This is consistent with findings by Herremans and Herremans-Tonnoeyr (2000) who found that Tawny Eagle densities in Botswana declined significantly with an increase in distance away from protected land. In particular, the species seems to have disappeared from large parts of the Northern Cape, Free State and Limpopo provinces. A small, sparsely distributed population persists in the grassy Karoo where they have capitalised on power-lines, using pylons as nest structures (Simmons 1997b).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no clear seasonal movements and the species appears to be sedentary (Steyn 1982). It is considered to be a vagrant to Lesotho (Osborne and Tigar 1990). In different parts of southern Africa, population densities depend on soil types and primary productivity (Hustler and Howells 1986) and on the extent of protected areas (Tarboton and Allan 1984, Brown 1991b), with densities much higher (1.5 pairs/100 km2) within conservation areas than outside (0.3-1 pair/100 km2). The AoO provided by SABAP2 is 98 187 km2 of which 34 146 km2 is protected and 64 031 km2 unprotected. While the EoO estimates have decreased only marginally (9%) between SABAP1 and SABAP2, the AoO has decreased by 58% since SABAP1 (mainly 1987-1993).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population was estimated to be at least 100 000 mature individuals (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Simmons (1997c) provided an estimate of 5 000 mature individuals in southern Africa, while Barnes (2000d) provided a population estimate of c. 1 600 mature individuals for the region, i.e. South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. Simmons et al. (2015) estimated the Namibian population to number c. 1 510 mature individuals. The population in southern Mozambique was estimated at approximately 40 mature individuals (Parker 1999). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Estimation of a regional population is difficult due to wide variation in population densities across the species' range (Simmons 1997b). Extrapolation of the published density estimates (Tarboton and Allan 1984, Brown 1991b), taking into account the ratio of protected areas to unprotected areas, results in a population of c. 700-1 150 mature individuals in the region. This may be an overestimate given that Murn et al. (2012), based upon a nest survey, provided a breeding population for Kruger National Park (the stronghold for the species in South Africa) of just 172 mature individuals. The regional population is consequently more likely to be c. 500-800 mature individuals. The confidence in this population estimate is low and requires further investigation.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be stable in the absence of evidence of any declines or substantial threats (BirdLife International 2014ab). Historical information suggests that the Tawny Eagle has decreased in numbers, as well as range, in the western Karoo in the previous century (Boshoff et al. 1983). Monadjem and Rasmussen (2008) reported that the Tawny Eagle changed from being one of the most frequently observed eagles in Swaziland in the 1970s to being possibly extinct as a breeding species. Outside of the region, Brown (1991b) mentioned a decline in Namibia, while Simmons et al. (2015) estimated a greater than 50% decline in the Namibian population over the past three generations or 50 years. The decrease in the regional population would appear to be larger and is almost certainly greater than 60% over the past 50 years. The confidence in this trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Tawny Eagles are found in lightly wooded savannah and thornveld, as well as semi-desert (Simmons 1997b), but avoid dense forest and highlands. Adults maintain a year-round territory of approximately 70 km2 (Tarboton and Allan 1984), but do respond to temporarily favourable environmental conditions, or biological phenomena such as irruptions of Red-billed Quelea Quelea quelea or Armoured Ground Crickets Acanthoplus discoidalis. Their prey and feeding habitats are similar to that of the Bateleur Terathopius ecaudatus, with scavenging and piracy being two of the most important foraging strategies (Watson et al. 1984). Breeding occurs in winter (Hustler and Howells 1989). Reproductive success in parts of South Africa and Zimbabwe ranged between 0.65-0.68 young/pair/year (Tarboton and Allan 1984, Hustler and Howells 1989). The generation length of 16.6 years is the mean of two calculated values derived from published and/or extrapolated estimates of mean age at first breeding, maximum longevity in the wild and mean annual adult survival (BirdLife International 2014ab).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Tawny Eagle is one of the most threatened eagles in South Africa (Barnes 2000d), with a high sensitivity to land transformation making it largely dependent on conservation areas to survive (Herremans and Herremans-Tonnoeyr 2000). Heavy losses have been documented for large raptors venturing outside of protected areas (Herholdt and Kemp 1997) and the Tawny Eagle is no exception. Owing to its habit of scavenging, Tawny Eagles, together with Bateleurs, suffer the most from deliberate and inadvertent poisoning (Tarboton and Allan 1984). Livestock farmers directly persecute the species because of the perception that the birds catch domestic livestock and poultry, or foul drinking water (Simmons 1997b, Anderson 2000a). Birds are also inadvertently killed or injured in gin traps set to capture mammalian predators (Anderson 2000a). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A decrease in wildlife populations in cattle-farming regions of Namibia resulted in a decrease in Tawny Eagle densities (Brown 1988a), although it is unknown if similar decreases have taken place in South Africa. Tawny Eagles, in addition to several other raptor species in South Africa, are susceptible to drowning in sheer-walled reservoirs (Anderson et al. 1999). Birds have been killed by electrocution (Anderson 2000a, Barnes 2000d) although, conversely, the Tawny Eagle has benefited from using electricity pylons as nesting sites (Anderson 2000a). Individuals feeding on road-killed carrion are occasionally killed by motor vehicles (Oatley et al. 1998). Monadjem and Rasmussen (2008) attributed declines of the Swaziland population to habitat loss and nest disturbance.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Birds of Prey Working Group of the Endangered Wildlife Trust has been active with an awareness and education programme for land-owners and stock farmers in Northern Cape, which has been successful in reducing the number of poisoning incidents (AJ Botha pers. comm.). Two projects run under the auspices of the programme assist with the conservation of Tawny Eagles. The Kalahari Raptor Project focuses on the monitoring and conservation of all raptors in the Kalahari region of South Africa, with a core focus on the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and adjacent areas. The Lowveld/Kruger National Park Large Bird Project includes this species in its annual aerial survey of the Kruger National Park and is in the process of obtaining a reliable estimate of the breeding population of this species in the Lowveld. The species is protected in Northern Cape under the Cape Province Nature and Environmental Conservation Ordinance; No. 19 of 1974, while in Swaziland the species is protected under the Swaziland Game Act, No 51 of 1953.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. To secure healthy populations of Tawny Eagles, as well as other large, resident eagles, large buffer zones with special management plans are needed around formally protected areas. Vulture restaurants within these buffer zones, which would be utilised by Tawny Eagles, should be promoted. The proactive installation of anti-electrocution, bird-friendly structures should continue. Decreasing the amount of poisoning is crucial to the long-term survival of the Tawny Eagle, although a total ban is impractical as it threatens the agro-chemical industry and is too idealistic to be successful.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional Southern Ground-Hornbill Bucorvus leadbeateri population meets the population-size criterion for regionally Endangered, based on an observed, estimated and projected population size reduction over a three generation period, in the past (A2) or where the time period includes both the past and the future (A4), and where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased, or may not be understood, or may not be reversible, based on (b) an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon, (c) decline in Area of Occupancy, Extent of Occurrence and/or quality of habitat, and (d) actual or potential levels of exploitation. In addition, the population size is estimated to number less than2 500 mature individuals and to be undergoing a continuous decline of at least 20% over the next two generations satisfying criterion C1.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global range of this species occurs within the region. The species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in the 2000 Red List assessment and as globally Vulnerable in 2015.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are currently no notable issues, but unpublished genetic work showed there to be at least northern (Kenya and Tanzania) and southern (South Africa and neighbouring countries) management sub-units. More work is currently being undertaken to understand the differentiation between these populations, and populations in intervening areas.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">90-130 cm, 3.3-4.4 kg. An unmistakeable, large, black bird with white primaries. Adults have bare, red, inflatable skin on the throat and face, with females showing a blue patch across the throat at the base of the lower mandible. Males also have a larger bill and casque than females at all ages. Juveniles are sooty black, their white primaries flecked with black. Dull grey eyes change to bright yellow as birds mature. Immatures have dull grey facial skin, which changes to creamy yellow, orange and red as they mature over 4-6 years. The legs and bill are black, but immatures have paler grey areas on the proximal sides of their mandibles (Kemp 1995a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species occurs in suitable habitat in Kenya, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, and South Africa (Kemp 1995a, Jordan 2011). In Swaziland, it was encountered only in the north-east in Hlane Royal National Park, Mlawula Nature Reserve and Mbuluzi Game Reserve (Monadjem et al. 2003). The EoO in South Africa has declined by approximately 66% in 115 years, or less than 3 generations (Kemp and Webster 2008), with about half of the regional population found in large protected areas, primarily Kruger National Park and Adjacent Private Nature Reserves. Groups outside this stronghold are patchily distributed in areas unaffected by expansion of rural communities, afforestation, bush encroachment, livestock diseases and cultivation (Morrison et al. 2005, Jordan 2011).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Birds are resident and occupy territories of up to 100-250 km2/group, depending on habitat quality (Jordan 2011, Theron 2011). Females occasionally move between groups and are sometimes found singly or in small groups of 2-3 members (Kemp 1995a). Throughout the species' range, it occurs in habitats broadly classified as grassland and savannah, but it is absent from arid semi-deserts and extensive forests (Kemp 1995a, Jordan 2011). A comparison of the EoO and AoO estimates of SABAP1 and SABAP2 show that, while the EoO of the species has not changed significantly since 1993, the AoO has decreased by 53.91%. It is unevenly represented in the Important Bird Area network with a reporting rate of 58.20% in Kruger National Park and reporting rates of less than1% in all other IBAs.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of Southern Ground-Hornbill has not been quantified, owing to insufficient monitoring (BirdLife International 2014ac). Kemp (2000) provided a regional population estimate of 1 500-2 000 mature individuals based on densities from studies within Kruger National Park and central KwaZulu-Natal of territories of 100 km2/group (Kemp and Kemp 1974, Knight 1990), a breeding structure of one alpha breeding pair per group (Kemp and Kemp 1980) and a mean group size of 3.6 birds (Vernon 1986, Kemp et al. 1989, Knight 1990). This estimate was revised to 410-700 groups (1 290-2 380 individuals) in the initial working document for a PHVA process during 2005, with 1 500 breeding individuals and a threshold for saturation of 3 000 individuals used in the final Vortex modelling exercise (Morrison et al. 2005, 2007b). The confidence in this estimate was high. An alternative analysis (Kemp and Webster 2008), using similar data based on biome extent and SABAP1 reporting frequencies, estimating 1 398 individuals in 1992 and 3 124 historically, which corroborates the Vortex estimates.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Subjective regional declines were reported for Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya, hence the increased global concern which resulted in the elevation of this species to globally Vulnerable (BirdLife International 2014ac). In South Africa, the species is known to have undergone a decline of greater than 50% over the past three generations, as inferred from analyses of historical and atlas data (Kemp and Webster 2008).</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Ground-Hornbill is a monogamous, cooperative breeder with a single, dominant breeding pair within a group supported by helpers (Kemp 2005a). Natural cavities in live or dead trees are most commonly used, but also cliffs and, rarely, self-excavated hollows in earth banks or old stick nests of other species. Artificial cavities are readily accepted. Chicks hatch asynchronously with the second hatched chick normally falling victim to passive siblicide, being unable to compete with its larger sibling (Kemp 2005a), or to parental cannibalism. 49% of breeding attempts fledge one chick and 31% of fledged chicks survive to maturity (Kemp 2005a). Mean recruitment is extremely low, with groups fledging an average of only one chick every 9.3 years (n=14 groups, 20 breeding seasons; Kemp 1988), making the species exceptionally vulnerable to any type of increased mortality. A generation length of 31.3 years is estimated based on mean age at first breeding, maximum longevity in the wild and mean annual adult survival (BirdLife International 2014ac). The species has a catholic diet, feeding on a range of invertebrates and small amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threats to the Southern Ground-Hornbill are habitat alteration, and especially loss of large trees with suitable cavities for nesting, as well as afforestation of grassland, or bush encroachment of savannah (Kemp 2005a). Other factors that contribute to declines in population numbers include poisoning, electrocution and persecution of groups for breaking windows of buildings or cars when hammering at reflections with their bills (Kemp and Webster 2008). The birds are apparently only rarely collected for use in traditional practices, but they still appear in markets (Bruyns et al. 2013, Whiting et al. 2013).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Southern Ground-Hornbill Action Group was formed in 2005 (Morrison et al. 2007b) and involves all role-players focused on the conservation and monitoring of this iconic African species. This group revised a Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) for the species, originally compiled in 2005, and a Species Recovery Plan in 2011. These documents form the basis of the work undertaken by the Southern Ground-Hornbill Action Group. Conservation activities include establishment of a viable captive-breeding population and introduction of redundant, second-hatched, hand-reared chicks to re-establish groups within areas of the historical range that are still considered suitable for this purpose. The Southern Ground-Hornbill is listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No 7 of 2003.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Ground-Hornbill Action Group is working on a number of conservation activities. A document outlining appropriate criteria for proposed sites for re-introduction is being compiled.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The decrease in the regional population of African Marsh Harrier Circus ranivorus is believed to be sufficiently rapid to satisfy the thresholds for regionally Endangered under the population trend criterion A2 (greater than 50 % decline over a 24 year period (three generations)). The population size is believed to fulfil the requirements for regionally Endangered under the population size criterion C1 (less than2 500 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be greater than 20% in the next five years or two generations, or with a specified population structure). </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global range of this species occurs within the region. In addition, it was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and underwent a decrease in AoO of greater than 30% in the period between SABAP1 and SABAP2.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">44-49 cm, 430-570 g. A long-winged, long-tailed brown wetland raptor. Little sexual dimorphism, although adult females have slightly darker plumage than males. Upperparts dark brown with feathers edged rufous. Underparts lighter brown with white and brown streaking on throat, breast and flanks. Upperwings dark brown while coverts have white flecking. Underwings pale buff, with obvious barring and are dark tips. Tail light brown with dark barring. Bill grey with dull yellow cere. Eyes, legs, and feet yellow. Juveniles darker than adults, with creamy colouration on nape, forehead, shoulders and upperwing coverts although the extent of this colouration is variable. Eyes dark brown, while cere is green-yellow (Simmons 2005e).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Marsh Harrier is sparsely distributed across wetlands throughout central and east Africa, and southwards to southern Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is absent from areas with less than300 mm of annual rainfall (Simmons 1997c). The Okavango Delta in northern Botswana is considered to be a stronghold (Simmons 1997c), with the species also occurring in neighbouring Zimbabwe and Mozambique (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Within the region, it occurs in high densities in higher rainfall coastal regions from Zululand down to Western Cape, as well as in Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Limpopo and North West provinces (Simmons 2005e). It is absent from the drier parts of Northern Cape and inland areas parts of Western Cape. In Swaziland, the species is patchily distributed across the Highveld in the west of the country and is a non-breeding visitor to the eastern Lowveld (Parker 1994). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The EoO estimates indicate that the species' overall range has not contracted between the atlas periods, but the AoO estimates show an alarming 46.51% decline at sites within its original range. It is unlikely that short-term fluctuations due to rodent populations and rainfall can explain the decrease in AoO as SABAP2 data gathering has been running for more than five years (RE Simmons pers comm.). In addition, the species is easily identifiable and highly conspicuous when foraging. The African Marsh Harrier is well represented within the Important Bird Area network in the region, although the decrease in AoO outside of these sites is a cause for concern.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014ad). Cohen (2000) estimated there to be 6 000-10 000 mature individuals in the region. The number of mature individuals present in Swaziland is not known (Monadjem et al. 2003), but is estimated to be less than100. Tarboton and Allan (1984) estimated that a pair of African Marsh Harriers requires a minimum of 100 ha of wetland as a breeding territory. The current regional AoO is approximately 3 000 km2 or 300 000 ha which could, conceivably, hold up to 6 000 mature individuals. The uncertainty as to how many wetlands of greater than 100 ha within the region are occupied, the relative densities at which this species occurs in different habitat types, and the area outside of wetlands that is required for foraging, make estimating a regional population problematic. The rapid decline in AoO indicated by SABAP2 suggests that the 20% decline in the regional population predicted by Cohen (2000) has indeed occurred, and in all likelihood has occurred more rapidly than predicted. It is estimated that the current regional population is 3 500-4 500 mature individuals. The confidence in this regional population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is in decline (BirdLife International 2014ad). Provided the estimate of 6 000-10 000 mature individuals in the region by Cohen (2000) is accurate, then the decrease in the regional population over the past three generations is estimated to be c. 85%. This would mean that in 1988 (3 generations ago) the estimated population would have been approximately 20 000 mature individuals, which may be an overestimate based on the amount of available habitat within the region. Accordingly, the decrease in the regional population is believed to be closer to 60% over the past three generations. The confidence in this estimate is low and requires verification.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species is dependent on permanent wetlands, both inland and coastal, for breeding, feeding and roosting. It also hunts over drier floodplains, grasslands, croplands, and Fynbos, where it preys mainly on small rodents (Simmons 2005e), as well as birds, reptiles, frogs and insects. Nests are usually placed in reedbeds over water, although breeding has been recorded in adjacent sedges, Fynbos, scrub and agricultural fields, but these are considered to be rare occurrences (Kemp and Kemp 2006). Breeding adults are largely sedentary (Simmons 2005e) with pairs often retaining the same territory year after year (Simmons 1990) while juveniles disperse widely. The generation length of 7.8 years was calculated from the mean of two calculated values derived from published and/or extrapolated estimates of mean age at first breeding, maximum longevity in the wild and mean annual adult survival (BirdLife International 2014ad).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat faced by this species is loss and degradation of its sensitive wetland habitats, brought about by drainage or damming for development and agriculture (Monadjem et al. 2003), as well as pollution. Changes in the extent of moist wetland edges and surrounding grassland (i.e. prey habitat) could be more significant than changes in the extent of permanently inundated wetland and reedbeds (CA Whittington-Jones pers. comm.) although the species may partly be able to adapt to constructed wetlands, e.g. dams and sewage works. Inappropriate burning regimes and intense grazing have also negatively affected marsh harriers (Cohen 2000). With increases in development as well as agriculture, many wetlands and other potential habitat will be drained and so this species is likely to continue to decline. Direct disturbance, especially during the breeding season when harriers are intolerant of humans, may also be a threat. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are currently no national conservation actions in place for this species. On a provincial scale, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and Western Cape have incorporated the needs of African Marsh Harriers into provincial conservation plans.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Biodiversity Management Plan, including a Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA), is required for this species. As a priority, all wetlands that are greater than 100 ha in extent need to be identified by provincial conservation departments and prioritised for protection within future conservation plans. Included in this process must be an allowance for appropriate buffers surrounding wetlands. Projects that encourage resource stewardship of wetlands should be encouraged. The species should be included in environmental education programmes run by NGOs working around wetlands. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the near-endemic Black Harrier Circus maurus has been quantified at less than1 000 mature individuals with an estimated continuing decline of at least 20% within the next two generations. In addition, at least 95% of mature individuals are present within a single sub-population. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The vast majority of the global distribution of the Black Harrier falls within the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues. </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">48-53 cm, 375-550 g. Adults are unmistakable in their pied plumage with the upperparts and underparts almost entirely black. Sexes are similar although females in bright light have a brownish sheen to the head, mantle and back (males are black); males also exhibit more grey in the primaries. Underwings have extensive white in the primaries and secondaries; outer primaries and secondaries are edged black. Tail long and barred. Rump white. Bill black with a bright yellow cere. Eyes yellow. Legs and feet rich yellow. Juveniles have dark brown upperparts, with buffy tips to the contour feathers. Underparts pale brown with heavy dark streaking on the neck and breast. Underwing coverts buffy with the primaries having extensive white bases and the secondaries showing light grey barring. Bill black with dull yellow cere. Legs and feet yellow. Eye colour changes from brown to yellow with age (Simmons et al. 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Black Harrier is one of the most range-restricted harrier species in the world, with the core of its range located in the Fynbos Biome of south-western South Africa (Simmons 2000a). Peripheral populations extend to the southern reaches of the Karoo and Grassland biomes (Curtis et al. 2004). The species is thought to have lost up to 50% of its core breeding habitat in the last century owing to extensive land transformation by agriculture (particularly in the Overberg), invasive alien vegetation, and urbanisation within the Fynbos Biome (Curtis et al. 2004). An isolated population of about 10 mature individuals occurs in northern coastal Namibia, where they may breed. Within the region, the species is restricted to South Africa and Lesotho where it has a large Extent of Occurrence (400 000 km2), with the highest densities occurring in Western Cape as well as the grasslands of Free State and Eastern Cape provinces. The Black Harrier has a polarised distribution in the Fynbos Biome, with breeding birds restricted to the coastal strip and inland in the mountains (Curtis et al. 2004). This distribution is a reflection of the birds' preference for cooler south-facing slopes and mountains, as well as land-use patterns in the region, with intensive agricultural development being concentrated on the flat, relatively fertile lowlands but largely absent along the coastal strip and steeper mountain slopes (Curtis et al. 2004, Jenkins et al. 2012). Black Harriers undergo seasonal migrations during the summer (see map): travelling as far as 1 200 km eastwards to Lesotho and Free State grasslands, from the Western Cape, returning in winter (RE Simmons unpubl. data). The species can be irruptive in certain areas such as Free State grasslands and Northern Cape, in response to food availability, being abundant one year and completely absent the next (BD Colahan and RE Simmons unpubl. data).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the Black Harrier is estimated to be less than1 000 mature individuals. Only c. 10 mature individuals occur outside of the region. The confidence in this estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population is thought to have undergone a major (85%) decline in the past 100 years (17% in 20 years) owing to loss of large swathes of indigenous Renosterveld vegetation in parts of the Overberg, Western Cape (Curtis 2005). Indeed, in the Western Cape the species is estimated to have declined by at least 50%, with birds having disappeared from the Cape Flats as well as the Overberg (Curtis 2005). It is predicted that the species will undergo a continuous decline of greater than 20% over the next two generations (15 years). The confidence in this population trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Favoured breeding habitat is Fynbos, particularly Strandveld and Mountain Fynbos. In fragmented Renosterveld habitat it is only found in high-quality patches greater than 100 ha in size (or where fragments are inter-connected). Foraging habitat also includes high-altitude grasslands and alpine meadows, down to Karoo scrub, semi-desert, marshy floodplains and, less often, croplands. Small mammals dominate the diet in coastal areas, while the diet changes with altitude and habitat: birds (especially quail) form 50% of the diet in montane areas (Curtis et al. 2004). Where indigenous vegetation occurs, birds forage on average 11 km away from their nest with maximum round trips of up to 50 km (RE Simmons unpubl. data). Where indigenous vegetation is more limited, this may be reduced to 2-3 km from their nests (Curtis 2005). In their summer quarters in Lesotho, satellite-tagged birds occupied small home ranges of 63-66 km2, much smaller than in coastal areas inland of Langebaan Lagoon where tagged birds covered 242 km2. Under ideal conditions, a pair will raise, on average, two young per breeding attempt in coastal areas, 1.4 young in lowland Renosterveld sites and 1.1 young in montane sites where more than half of the nests fail (Curtis 2005). Recent evidence suggests breeding birds move around at night and they may be hunting then (RE Simmons unpubl. data). A generation length of 7.8 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014ae).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The main threats facing this species include habitat loss and fire (Barnes 2000e). Almost no nests occur in transformed lowland landscapes (Curtis et al. 2004), and transformation over the past 150 years has resulted in 90% of the fertile, lowland areas of the western and south-western coastal plains being lost (Kemper et al. 2000), representing a significant decrease in breeding habitat for Black Harriers. Birds are thus forced to breed in sub-optimal locations (i.e. montane areas) which require adults to travel further to provision their chicks. The longer distances and time spent away from the nest affect the frequency of food provision, which depresses clutch size and nestling growth rates (Jenkins 2000a). It also increases the levels of predation in these areas relative to coastal regions (Curtis et al. 2004). A large proportion of the population is found on private land and hence is susceptible to changes in land-use (Chadwick 1997). About 60% of the 150 breeding sites known are found in protected areas, suggesting that intact habitats and prey bases are essential for the wellbeing of this species. The population of the species appears to fluctuate, possibly with fluctuations in its prey-base, which is mainly small rodents (Barnes 2000e, Simmons et al. 2005). Long-term impacts that depress the abundance of small mammals are likely to consequently affect Black Harrier numbers. Other long-term threats include climate change impacts such as decreasing rainfall and increasing temperature in their core breeding areas on the West Coast (B Hewitson pers comm.). A decrease in ground moisture is likely to reduce suitable nest sites (because damp areas are preferred) and decrease mouse populations that breed less prolifically in dry conditions (Retief 2011). More frequent fires, which are being experienced in Western Cape, are also likely to cause declines in both breeding and food requirements. The proliferation of wind farms in the core breeding areas (Western Cape coast to Northern Cape), as well as in the newly discovered summer range in Lesotho, means that harriers may be impacted at both ends of their migratory cycle. This is an unknown threat, but the species is high on the collision-sensitivity list of the Birds and Wind Energy Specialist Group.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Black Harrier breeding ecology and threats have been studied in a 12-year programme run under the auspices of the Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology, University of Cape Town. The focus has been on the effects of habitat fragmentation and the utility of Black Harrier as indicators of biodiversity health in global biodiversity hotspots in Western Cape. A large group of harrier enthusiasts assists in monitoring birds from KwaZulu-Natal to Northern Cape, and Black Harriers are now part of the BirdLife South Africa Species Champions Programme. In the early 2000s work was undertaken towards establishment of a stewardship programme in the Overberg in which farmers were encouraged to practice conservation-friendly farming to benefit the few remaining pairs of harriers there. A pilot study was recently undertaken to examine the dispersal and behaviour of satellite-tagged Black Harriers with a focus on discovering where they disperse to in the winter as well as movement, home range and survival away from core breeding areas and how this influences population numbers. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Species Action Plan, as well as Biodiversity Management Plan, is recommended. The importance of conservation actions in Lesotho has only recently come to light;  conservation measures must include the cooperation of the Lesotho government. Migration periods appear to be the time of highest mortality for Black Harriers, and ways of reducing mortality during migration should be investigated.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the specialised, partly nocturnal Bat Hawk Macheiramphus alcinus is stable, but estimated to be less than250 mature individuals satisfying criterion D1 (population size estimated to number less than250) and justifying its reassessment as regionally Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Bat Hawk is nowhere common throughout its global range, with an estimated global population of 1 000-10 000 individuals provided by BirdLife International (2014af). The regional population could represent up to 5% of the global population; following a precautionary approach, the species is included in the 2015 assessment.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Bat Hawk belongs to the monotypic genus Macheiramphus. Three subspecies are recognised. M. alcinus alcinus from Myanmar, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo and Sulawesi; M. a. papuanus of eastern New Guinea; and M. a. anderssoni from the low-lying, moist woodlands in Africa south of the Sahara, and Madagascar. However, there is debate as to whether the species is actually monotypic (Sibley and Monroe 1990).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">45 cm, 600-650 g. A unique raptor likely to be seen at its roost tree during the day, or hunting bats in the evening. Sexes are similar in plumage, but females are slightly larger (Brown et al. 1982). Mostly blackish brown above, with a variable amount of white below, especially on the throat and abdomen; the chest appears mottled black on brown. The amount of white on the throat varies (absent in some), but there is a black streak along the centre of the throat (Steyn 1982). There is a short occipital crest and two white nape spots. The slender black bill has a wide gape. Cere bluish grey. Legs and toes bluish white; talons black. Rectrices brown with indistinct pale greyish brown bars. Remiges dark brown with white spots on the inner webs. Juveniles are similar to pale form adults, but are more extensively white below, except for a dark brown band across the breast. </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species has an extremely wide global distribution. The African race, M. a. anderssoni, occurs in sub-Saharan Africa from Gambia east to Ethiopia, and south to the subtropical regions of eastern South Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In southern Africa, it occurs from northern Namibia, east to northern Botswana and the Okavango Delta, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. In South Africa, it has been recorded in the extreme north-eastern parts of Limpopo Province, along the northern Drakensberg Escarpment and the southern slopes of the Soutpansberg, as well as in the Lowveld regions of Mpumalanga. Vagrants are occasionally reported from KwaZulu-Natal (Pooley 1967), Gauteng and even Eastern Cape provinces. The Bat Hawk occurs regularly in four IBAs in the region, namely Kruger National Park (SA002), Soutpansberg (SA003), Wolkberg Forest Belt (SA005) and Blyde River Canyon (SA127). Its occurrence is unpredictable and isolated vagrant records suggest some nomadism or dispersing juveniles. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is nowhere common, with an estimated global population of 1 000-10 000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014af). Bat Hawks occur at low densities in the region. For example, in the Tzaneen district of Limpopo, four pairs occupy an area of c. 300 km2, with a mean distance to the nearest neighbouring nest of 14.5 km (GD Engelbrecht unpubl. data). At the time of writing, Bat Hawks had been recorded in only 21 pentads during SABAP2 and, given their large home ranges of greater than 450 km2, it is possible that records from some neighbouring pentads represent the same individual/pair. It is difficult to estimate population numbers owing to the species' crepuscular and nocturnal habits and its habit of roosting in densely foliaged trees. It may, therefore, be under-recorded, but at present, the available evidence suggests a population size of 75-100 mature individuals in the region. The confidence in this estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend appears to be stable (BirdLife International 2014af). Most monitored nest sites active in SABAP1 were still active in SABAP2, and the regional population likewise appears to be stable. Nevertheless, although the species does not appear to be under any immediate threat in the region, it deserves close monitoring. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is most widespread in evergreen forests and low-lying mesic woodland, often in hilly country, and also major river valleys and areas with suitable roosting sites for bats, e.g. caves, old mine workings and Baobab Adansonia digitata trees (Hustler and Dean 2005a). It extends marginally into dry savannah where there are areas where bats and plantations exist. It is often found near human habitation.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is generally sparse throughout its range and has large home ranges (greater than 450 km2). It is therefore difficult to assess all threats. These hawks show little fear of humans, making them an easy target for persecution, e.g. for perceived predation on chickens (Hustler and Dean 2005a). Locally, it may be threatened indirectly by deforestation, which may impact upon bat populations. It is not known to be affected by pesticides, but its principal food source, insectivorous bats, may be negatively affected. In South Africa, nests tend to be built on the outer branches of pale, smooth-barked trees (especially Eucalyptus spp.), which renders them susceptible to destruction by strong winds. In general, the species appears to be relatively little affected by humans. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No direct conservation measures are underway. Nest monitoring takes place in the Tzaneen area and artificial nesting platforms have been placed at some nests. The University of Limpopo is monitoring nests to determine breeding success. Plantation managers in Limpopo are aware of nests on their properties and nesting trees are protected.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the aptly named Mangrove Kingfisher Halcyon senegaloides is suspected to have undergone a reduction of 50% over the last 10 years (A2). The species also meets the threshold for regionally Endangered status under B2 (area of occupancy less than500 km2, and experiencing a continuing decline in area of occupancy and area, extent and/or quality of habitat). In addition, the regional population is estimated to be less than2 500 mature individuals, with no sub-population estimated to contain more than 250 mature individuals (C2a(i)).</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Possible hybrids between Mangrove Kingfishers and Woodland Kingfishers H. senegalensis, have been reported from southern Malawi (Hanmer 1983, 1984, 1989a).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">22-24 cm, 85 g. Sexes alike. Head dove-grey, with black patch on lores and around eyes, and paler supercilium and ear coverts. Remainder of upperparts azure-blue. Whitish below. Rectrices blue with black shafts. Wing coverts black, forming conspicuous patch on folded wing; alula, primary coverts and tertials azure. Remiges black, with white proximal patches on inner webs and blue on outer webs. Underwing coverts white except for black ‘comma' on carpals. Bill red. Eyes dark brown. Legs reddish, feet darker. Similar to Woodland Kingfisher, but distinguished by all-red bill, lack of black stripe behind eye, black carpal crescent on underwing, dove-grey head, reddish legs and mangrove or coastal riverine forest habitat. Juvenile Mangrove Kingfisher has a black-tipped bill (Turpie 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, along east coast from just north of equator in Somalia, through Kenya, Tanzania (including Pemba and Zanzibar islands), to Mozambique and South Africa. Within the region, strictly confined to coastal areas (less than150 masl) in KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces. The range is divided into two areas: a breeding range in Eastern Cape, and a non-breeding range in KwaZulu-Natal (Berruti 1997b). Within Eastern Cape, fairly common between Kei Mouth and Mbotyi, but apparently absent between Mbotyi and Umtamvuna River. Breeding has been confirmed at only a few sites in the Eastern Cape, including Kobonqaba (Pike 1966), Mazeppa Bay (Turkington 1984), Umgazi River Mouth (Kirschner 1984) and Silaka, Port St Johns (Boon 2000). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The non-breeding range in KwaZulu-Natal stretches from about Port Shepstone north to Kosi Bay, but in reality the species only occurs regularly at approximately six sites along the KwaZulu-Natal coast; from south to north these are Durban Bayhead, Beachwood Mangroves (Umgeni River), uMlalazi Nature Reserve, Umhlatuze Estuary and Casuarinas (Richards Bay), St Lucia (iSimangiliso) and Kosi Bay. Migrates in autumn from Eastern Cape breeding grounds to coastal KwaZulu-Natal (Berruti et al. 1994); in spring return migration proceeds in the opposite direction. During migration, the species occasionally visits suburban gardens (Botha and Botha 1991, Boon 1994, Davis 2005) and woodland/savannah habitats (Davis 2004). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">To what extent the South African population disperses northwards in winter is uncertain, nor is it known whether the entire Eastern Cape population moves in winter or only a portion of it. The populations in Mozambique (Parker 1999, 2005) appear to be isolated from that in South Africa. Sporadic reports from rivers in southern Kruger National Park (Newman 1980) may indicate movement up rivers from Mozambique's coastal plain. Localised and scarce in southern Mozambique (Parker 1999), but is more widespread in Sofala Province, in central Mozambique (Parker 2005, Davies et al. 2012).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A more refined calculation shows that the available wintering habitat is highly limited (less than10 km2) and restricted to only six sites. The extent of breeding habitat is not known for certain, but is unlikely to be greater than 50 km2 as the species only breeds in coastal riverine forest within a few kilometres (less than10 km) of the Indian Ocean, along banks of forested rivers and estuaries. Breeding has only been confirmed at four sites in Eastern Cape and there are unlikely to be more than 10-15 river mouths in that province with suitable riverine forest for breeding.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014ag). There is no information currently available on the size of the breeding population in Eastern Cape, which is a serious impediment to accurately assessing the Mangrove Kingfisher's true conservation status. On the non-breeding grounds in KwaZulu-Natal, the wintering population numbers between 25-110 individuals (Johnson et al. 1998, Allan et al. 1999, Turpie 2005a). The breeding population size is unknown, but the wintering population is very likely less than150 birds, indicating (on the assumption that all or most of the breeding population moves from Eastern Cape into KwaZulu-Natal during winter) that the breeding population is likely to be less than250 individuals. Confidence in this regional population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be decreasing although the rate of decline is unknown (BirdLife International 2014ag). The species has declined in Durban Bay where mangroves decreased by c. 97% between 1890-1990. Major harbour development at Richards Bay during the 1970s also greatly reduced mangrove habitat at that locality. Confidence in this regional population trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Breeds in coastal riverine forest, typically remaining within 30 m of rivers and estuaries (Boon 2000). Spends the non-breeding season in mangrove forests, where crabs and small fish abound; also eats lizards, prawns and insects. In Mozambique, reported up to 150 km inland in subtropical woodland mosaics where it is suspected to breed in nests of arboreal termites. </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat faced by the Mangrove Kingfisher is the destruction and degradation of its restricted habitat. In its non-breeding range in KwaZulu-Natal, the clearing of mangrove forests for harbour, industrial and other urban developments (Allan et al. 1999) is of great concern, while the destruction of riverine and coastal forests in Eastern Cape for housing, subsistence agriculture and fuel wood is likely to have had a negative impact on regional populations. A significant problem is that the majority of the South African breeding population appears to be concentrated in winter at only about six sites along the KwaZulu-Natal coast. This small number of wintering sites potentially leaves the species vulnerable to serious threat should any of these sites undergo modification or destruction. Although mortalities due to collisions with buildings have been recorded, this appears to be a relatively minor threat.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are currently no conservation measures underway focusing on this species.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. It also needs to be established what proportion of the Eastern Cape breeding population vacates to KwaZulu-Natal during winter. More accurate surveys of the wintering population in KwaZulu-Natal are needed, especially at the major wintering localities of Richards Bay, uMlalazi Nature Reserve and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the localised and easily overlooked Botha's Lark Spizocorys fringillaris satisfies criterion B2 (an AoO of less than500 km2 and a continuing decline, observed, inferred or projected in (ii) area of occupancy; (iii) area, extent and/or quality of habitat; (iv) number of locations or sub-populations and (v) number of mature individuals. Furthermore, the global population is estimated to number less than2 500 mature individuals and is undergoing an estimated decline of greater than 20% over two generations. Breeding success and long-term survival are threatened by unfavourable land-use practices. Consequently this dwindling endemic is assessed as regionally Endangered. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Botha's Lark is endemic to the region. In addition, the species was assessed as regionally Endangered in 2000 and globally Endangered in 2015. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues. </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">13-14 cm, 18 g. Sexes alike. A small, fairly squat and finch-like lark. Carriage generally upright but squats down when foraging. Crown and mantle dark brown with heavy black streaking. Rump grey-brown with darker feather centres. Uppertail coverts plain brown. Chin and throat greyish white. Breast and flanks yellow-buff to rufous buff, shading to pale buff or white on lower belly and undertail coverts. Breast heavily streaked with black; flanks with thinner streaks. Face pattern and creamy supercilium fairly distinct. Wing coverts brown with darker centres. Remiges brown with thin buff outer edges. Tail often fanned in flight, exhibiting broad white outer panels on outermost rectrix, and white panels with dark tips on penultimate rectrix; remainder of rectrices blackish brown. Bill thin and short; pink or orange-pink. Eyes brown. Legs and feet pink. Juvenile similar but shows a spotted pattern above due to whitish feather tips. Breast not streaked but diffusely spotted with rufous-brown. Bill initially horn-coloured. Most readily located by its short, finch-like flight calls (Herholdt and Grobler 1987, Dean 2005c, Peacock 2012).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Botha's Lark is endemic to eastern South Africa's upland grasslands, with a restricted distribution centred on south-eastern Mpumalanga (Amersfoort, Bethal, Hendrina, Ermelo, Wakkerstroom, Volksrust and Standerton districts) and the adjacent eastern Free State (west of Wesselbron, Heilbron, Warden, Verkykerskop and Harrismith districts) (Barnes 2000f). The bulk of its population occurs in the Vaal River catchment. New atlas data suggest it may have disappeared from the northern end of its range in central Mpumalanga, as well as parts of north-eastern Free State. Nevertheless, recent sight records from the Memel-Vrede-Warden-Harrismith arc (Nuttall 1999), and near Kroonstad and Wesselbron (Earlé and Grobler 1987), show that there are previously overlooked populations in the eastern Free State (Maphisa et al. 2009). The highly specific breeding and foraging habitat requirements, together with extensive transformation of its natural habitat, partly account for the rarity and limited range of this species (Barnes 2000f). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Barnes (2000f) estimated the global population to be in the region of 1 500-5 000 individuals. The species no longer occurs at the type locality of Vredefort (Dean 1997a), and similar local extinctions are documented or suspected in major parts of its range. The species is localised and generally sparse, but can be locally common in suitable habitat, with densities of c. 1 bird/km2 recorded in Mpumalanga (Tarboton et al. 1987). A total global population of 1 000 to 20 000 birds was estimated by Allan et al. (1983), revised by Siegfried (1992) to 1 500-5 000 individuals. With evidence of range contractions and local extinction events, it is likely that the current population of Botha's Lark is smaller still, and is suspected to be less than2 500 individuals. However, detailed quantitative information and population and distribution surveys are required to draw more concrete conclusions. Confidence in this population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">With evidence of range contraction, it is possible that the current population of Botha's Lark has suffered a concomitant population decline. Data relating to population trends are lacking although the global population is suspected to have declined by at least 30% over the past three generations. The factors driving this predicted decline i.e. habitat loss and degradation, have not ceased and are likely to continue into the future. Confidence in this population trend estimate is low due to a lack of data. </p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Botha's Lark is confined to short upland grassland at altitudes of 1 500-1 900 masl in eastern South Africa. Within this restricted geographical area, it is further confined to flat or gently sloping grassland with short, dense, heavily grazed natural grass on plateaus and upper hill slopes. It is mostly found on shallow turf soils (Tarboton et al. 1987), and particularly black clay soils in the Moist Clay Highveld Grassland vegetation type (Barnes 2000f). Despite a widespread search in its stronghold in south-eastern Mpumalanga, Maphisa et al. (2009) recorded it in very few localities, indicating that the species is far more habitat-specific, within its Area of Occupancy, than originally thought. Botha's Lark is mostly restricted to fairly short grass (4-6 cm), either recently burned or unburned, but heavily grazed (Maphisa 2004). Likewise, Barnes (2000f) reported its preference for severely grazed and bare trampled patches, and the species often breeds in recently burnt grassland (Maphisa et al. 2009). Suitably cropped or recently burnt grassland habitat is often present in the vicinity of kraals and old lands, and where stock is concentrated; the species is frequently found in such locations, especially outside the breeding season (Earlé and Grobler 1987, Tarboton et al. 1987). It is also recorded from moist, open Themeda triandra grassland (Hall and Moreau 1970). It avoids rocky areas, taller grass in bottomlands and valleys, vleis, croplands and planted pastures (Allan et al. 1983, Dean and Allan 1997). It is usually found singly, in pairs on in small groups of 3-6, but occasionally in larger groups of up to 10 birds (Herholdt and Grobler 1987).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As is the case with most other threatened grassland species, habitat destruction and modification through agriculture is the principal threat faced by Botha's Lark. Increased fragmentation of this species' remaining habitat, coupled with its increasingly patchy occurrence with minimal contact between sub-populations, is of concern (Barnes 2000f). As it prefers heavily grazed grassland, such as on properties stocked with sheep or other livestock, or game animals, shifting of land-use practices away from mixed stock farming presents a major threat. Unsuitable fire regimes may also be detrimental; Maphisa et al. (2009) suggested that late burning of grassland may shorten the potential breeding season and force a peak in breeding that coincides with high predator numbers. A proportion of the core distribution lies within the Vaal River Basin, an important water catchment area not susceptible to commercial afforestation. However, at the edge of its range, such as along the Mpumalanga Escarpment, the species may be locally displaced by afforestation practices (Allan et al. 1997b). The severity of this threat is now thought to be lower than previously suspected. Other potential immediate threats are human population expansion, urbanisation and mining. Botha's Lark is considered as being at low risk to the effects of climate change (Simmons et al. 2004). Given its geographically limited, fragmented and decreasing distribution, the loss of even a small, localised sub-population could have a significant effect on the long-term survival of this endemic species.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">To date no conservation actions that focus specifically on Botha's Lark have been put in place. Being a small, cryptic and easily overlooked species, Botha's Lark has not received the conservation attention that its already precarious, and apparently worsening status, urgently warrants.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA), culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan, is recommended. The species is not represented in formally conserved areas and is currently absent from the protected area network (Siegfried 1992). The conservation of Moist Clay Highveld Grassland, which is critical for the conservation of Botha's Lark, has largely been left to private land-owners. This species is heavily reliant on intense grazing and frequent burning to maintain its specific preferred microhabitat, and these conditions are mostly found on privately owned stock or game farms. Research into its ecological requirements, and the establishment and implementation of beneficial land-management plans (concerning especially grazing pressure and timing and frequency of burning) are essential. Close cooperation between conservation agencies and land-owners is thus imperative. Education, incentives, monitoring and encouragement of sustainable avitourism are valuable conservation approaches. Continued distribution mapping and field surveys are important steps towards identifying priority conservation areas. Research into how increasing population fragmentation is influencing this species' genetic integrity, is also a high priority (Barnes 2000f).</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Rudd's Lark Heteromirafra ruddi was assessed as Critically Endangered in the 2000 assessment; however, the threats faced by this unique highland endemic are less severe than previously feared. Nevertheless, it still satisfies the population size criterion for regionally Endangered (reduction of greater than 50% in the past three generations). The species has a small range, is known from few localities and is suspected to be experiencing a continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat, and number of mature individuals. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Rudd's Lark is endemic to the region. The species was assessed as regionally Critically Endangered in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The genus Heteromirafra is represented by three species of highly localised larks that form a superspecies (Keith et al. 1992): Rudd's Lark is endemic to South Africa's upland grasslands; Archer's Lark H. archeri is known from north-west Ethiopia, but has not been recorded since 1955; and Sidamo or Liben Lark, H. sidamoensis is restricted to a single grassland site in southern Ethiopia (BirdLife International 2014ah). All three species are facing extinction, partly due to human-induced habitat degradation, and partly because of their highly specific ecological requirements and consequently naturally small populations and restricted ranges (Hockey et al. 1988). The three species are similar in morphology and plumage, with short, thin tails, distinctively large heads, pale median crown stripes, disproportionately large legs and feet, extremely long and straight hind-claw spikes and upright postures. Rudd's Lark is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">14-15 cm, 26 g. Sexes alike. A highly localised lark, most often located by its song given during an extended aerial display flight. Distinctive in plumage and morphology, with bulbous head, short thin tail and upright posture; hind-claw spikes straight and long (12-20 mm in length). Attractively patterned on mantle and crown, with dark feather interiors and golden-buff feather edges creating scalloped markings. Crown blackish with a pale creamy line down centre; long erectile crown feathers extend down paler nape. Face plain greyish, with pale band around eye. Breast rich buff, lightly streaked darker. Rest of underparts pale buff to whitish. Tail thin and short with white panels on outer rectrices. Flight feathers dark brown with narrow rufous outer edges, forming dull rufous patch in flight. Wing coverts, tertials and scapulars dark with buff margins. Bill horn to pink with darker patch around nostrils. Eyes grey-brown. Legs and feet flesh-pink. Birds in worn plumage are duller, greyer and less vividly marked. Juveniles are similar to adults (Peacock 2012).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Rudd's Lark is a highly localised resident species, endemic to the high-altitude grasslands of eastern South Africa (Hockey et al. 1988). It has precise habitat requirements and therefore a naturally restricted range and small population; this situation is exacerbated by habitat modification by humans (Hockey et al. 1988). The core of its range is centred on south-eastern Mpumalanga (Wakkerstroom, Amersfoort, Belfast, Waterval Boven, Ermelo, Volksrust districts), eastern Free State (Warden, Verkykerskop, Memel) and north-western KwaZulu-Natal (Barnes 2000g). The species reaches its northern limits in the Steenkampsberg range near Dullstroom in Mpumalanga where a small, isolated population exists (Dean and Allan 1997).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Being notoriously inconspicuous unless singing, this species is easily overlooked, and increased observer awareness has led to its recent discovery, or rediscovery, in several areas. Brooke (1984) feared the species to be extinct in southern KwaZulu-Natal, but surveys in the 1980s confirmed that a small population persisted at Matatiele, about 300 km south of the main area of distribution (Hockey et al. 1988). In the 1990s, additional localities were discovered 200 km further south near Ncora Dam, in southern Transkei, as well as near Molteno in the eastern Eastern Cape (Dean and Allan 1997). Three specimens collected from the farm Nooitgedacht near Warden (Herholdt and Grobler 1987), and multiple sight records from the Memel-Vrede-Warden-Verkykerskop-Harrismith arc east of 29° E, revealed the existence of a substantial previously overlooked population in the eastern Free State/western KwaZulu-Natal border region (Hockey et al. 1988). The species was also reported from the Bedford/Chatsworth IBA (Maphisa 2004).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Distribution modelling suggests that Rudd's Lark may have a larger distribution than current records suggest (Maphisa et al. 2009). However, during SABAP2 data gathering, the species was reported only from the Memel-Verkykerskop area in Free State, and the Wakkerstroom-Amersfoort area of Mpumalanga, and a comparison between SABAP1 and SABAP2 data suggests a reduction in AoO of c. 55%. In addition, preliminary field surveys have prompted concerns about disappearances from former strongholds (Maphisa et al. 2009). However, it is likely that this cryptic and localised species still occurs, but was overlooked, in some areas where it was not recorded during SABAP2. Nevertheless, it is undeniably one of the most range-restricted birds in the region. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is generally scarce and patchily distributed even within the core of its range (Dean and Ryan 2005a). In optimal habitats it can occur at relatively high densities e.g. 15 singing males in approximately 4 km2 were documented at Matatiele (Hockey et al. 1988). In the Wakkerstroom district in Mpumalanga, one of the main strongholds (Hockey et al. 1988), it can also be locally common, e.g. five nests were located in 8 ha hectares of grassland fringing a small pan, where 11 displaying males were estimated to be present (Tarboton et al. 1987). Crude estimates suggest that Rudd's Lark has a global population of 1 500-5 000 individuals (Siegfried 1992), but estimates for the proposed Grassland Biosphere Reserve suggest that 2 500 individuals is a more realistic lower limit for the species (Barnes 2000g). This range is roughly equivalent to 1 700-3 300 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014ah). Taking into consideration the apparent absence from much of its former range according to SABAP2 records, together with predicted population declines (Allan et al. 1997b), a precautionary approach warrants that the global population should be considered to fall below the threshold of 2 500 mature individuals, thus classifying this species as regionally (and by default) globally Endangered. In the absence of more complete population and distribution data, confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Barnes (2000e) suggested that the population may decline by up to 80% over the next 15-20 years or three generations, thus classifying this species as Critically Endangered. However, its status was downgraded to Vulnerable in 2006, because the threats facing this species were not as severe as initially thought (BirdLife International 2014ah). Nevertheless, the population is probably decreasing (Maphisa et al. 2009), although the extent and tempo of this decrease are unclear. The total population may be significantly smaller as disappearances from former strongholds have been noted (BirdLife International 2014ah), and probable decreases in EoO and AoO were revealed by SABAP2 data. An estimate of a greater than 50% decline over the past three generations is provided. Confidence in this population trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Even within its restricted range, this specialised species is limited to a particular habitat, determined by a range of biotic, altitudinal, topographic and climatic variables; its distribution is therefore naturally fragmented and highly localised, both temporally and spatially (Barnes 2000g). It prefers short, sour grassland on flat or gently sloping plateaus and hilltops at altitudes of 1 700-2 200 m (mostly greater than 1 800 m; Maphisa et al. 2009). It is limited to areas with high rainfall, typically greater than 600 mm per year and in Mpumalanga, 800-1 000 mm per year (Tarboton et al. 1987). Furthermore, Rudd's Lark is virtually restricted to Sandy Highveld Grassland (sensu Low and Rebelo 1996). Dominant grass species within its preferred habitat include Themeda triandra, Tristachya leucothrix, Trachypogon spicatus, Heteropogon contortus and Eragrostis curvula (Hockey et al. 1988). In optimal habitats cover of Eragrostis curvula/E. chloromelas is high relative to Themeda triandra (Hockey et al. 1988).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Rudd's Lark typically breeds in sites with moderately to heavily grazed grass with short tussocks (Hockey et al. 1988), selecting sites with shorter than average grass height early in the breeding season. The species is often most numerous in intensely grazed grasslands, usually with trampled or bare patches, which suggests that high grazing pressure does not necessarily affect the birds adversely, given that it does not lead to heavy invasion of forbs and other non-grasses (Hockey et al. 1988). However, Maphisa (2004) noted that few breeding attempts occur in heavily grazed sites, possibly due to higher predation rates. Indeed, Maphisa et al. (2009) reported that birds were absent from the most heavily grazed sites, and that an increase in the extent of bare ground, possibly due to excessive grazing, may lead to territory desertion. Conversely, territories may also be abandoned if grass becomes too tall and dense. If some open ground for terrestrial foraging remains, birds may remain in grassland up to 40 cm in height (Maphisa 2004). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">An absence of forbs has been suggested as an important habitat requirement (Hockey et al. 1988), but pairs do occasionally nest in sites where forbs occur (Maphisa 2004); nevertheless, the presence of forbs (such as spinescent forb Acalypha spp.) may be a sign of deteriorating and overgrazed grasslands (Maphisa 2004). Suitable breeding habitat is maintained by annual burning and heavy winter grazing (Hockey et al. 1988); the latter was likely sustained in the pre-agricultural past by large herds of grazing ungulates, but today mostly by domesticated livestock (Maphisa et al. 2009). As nesting attempts appear to be clustered in the second half of the breeding season (with egg-laying occurring between October and April, with peaks in January to February), late burning of grasslands may shorten the breeding season, and could account for population decreases. Maphisa et al. (2009) suggested that this species does best in grassland burned before the start of the breeding season. Rudd's Larks also occur at the edges of pans and vleis (Tarboton et al. 1987), but avoid valley bottoms and lowlands, as well as dense cover, old croplands, ploughed fields, rocky areas, valley bottoms, lowlands, intensely modified grasslands, and slopes of greater than 10° (Maphisa 2004). The generation length is given as 3.8 years (BirdLife International 2014ah).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Rudd's Lark is a highly specialised and naturally localised inhabitant of grassland, the most threatened but least protected habitat in southern Africa (Dean and Allan 1997). Furthermore, it is estimated that less than1% of the maximum global population (c. 100 birds) occurs in formally protected areas (Siegfried 1992). As with most threatened grassland species, loss, degradation and fragmentation of its habitat are the main threats faced by Rudd's Lark, and has resulted in local population reductions (Barnes 2000g). Changes in its sensitive grassland habitat are mostly brought about by commercial afforestation, agricultural intensification or unfavourable pasture management. The first-mentioned is believed to constitute a major threat, particularly in the Wakkerstroom area (Barnes 2000g), although afforestation below the escarpment is believed to pose little threat to the species (Allan et al. 1997b). Direct habitat destruction for the purposes of mining, housing and human settlements and agricultural initiatives to alleviate food shortages, all have a negative impact on this species (Barnes 2000g). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A close relationship between grassland management, especially in terms of grazing pressure and fire regimes, the length of the breeding season, and nest success has been postulated (Maphisa et al. 2009). Unfavourable burning practices may also be detrimental to Rudd's Larks; for example, nesting success is higher in territories that were burned earlier in the breeding season, compared to territories that were burned later in the season, resulting in a shortened breeding windows and increased predation rates (Maphisa et al. 2009). Extensive wildfires may lead to local population declines and nest destruction. Rudd's Lark is believed to be at low risk from climate change (Simmons et al. 2004).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Understanding how this species responds to different land-use practices is central to conservation planning and it is critical to identify management practices suitable to maintaining its preferred habitat. Research has been conducted on the fine-scale habitat requirements of this species (Maphisa 2004, Maphisa et al. 2009). Site-based and regional conservation actions, such as developing land stewardship programmes and taking steps towards securing the future of the proposed Grassland Biosphere Reserve (which would encompass c. 8% of the global population) are being undertaken by BirdLife South Africa. At present, the only formally protected area supporting this species is Verloren Valei Nature Reserve near Dullstroom, Mpumalanga, where small numbers have been recorded (Barnes 2000g). Concerns have been expressed that this site, which was designated as a Ramsar site in 2001 (Ramsar number 1110) may no longer support the species, and field surveys are urgently required.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The long-term survival of Rudd's Lark is largely reliant on beneficial management of grasslands by private land-owners. In particular, this would entail maintaining suitable grazing levels, as under- and overgrazed sites appear to support fewer larks. Fire is used extensively as a tool to control ticks and disease, improve forage for livestock, remove accumulated litter and promote grass regeneration. However, Maphisa et al. (2009) identified an important relationship between timing of breeding, the length of the breeding season and nesting success. Ideally, grasslands should be burnt in September or earlier, before the onset of the main breeding season. Likewise, Hockey et al. (1988) suggested that the species would be favoured by annual burning and heavy winter grazing, but in practice this regime is impractical. Further research into the ecological requirements of Rudd's Lark, and the effects different management practices have on the species, should be undertaken. Identification and implementation of appropriate land-use practices should be encouraged through education and awareness campaigns, and possibly through financial incentives (Tarboton et al. 1987) or through the encouragement of sustainable ecotourism. At some of the key sites for this species, conservation of intact avian communities is desirable, as Rudd's Lark often overlaps with other threatened or Near Threatened bird species such as Botha's Lark Spizocorys fringillaris, Southern Bald Ibis Geronticus calvus and Yellow-breasted Pipit Anthus chloris.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Pel's Fishing Owl Scotopelia peli is estimated at 70-100 mature individuals, qualifying it as regionally Endangered under criterion D1.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global range occurs in the region. In addition, the species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">63 cm, 2.14 kg. A massive, unmistakable owl easily identified by its orange-rufous plumage, round head with large, dark eyes and no distinct facial disk. The sexes are similar in appearance, although males have a deeper rufous colouration while females are slightly larger. Plumage is covered by dark spots, bars or transverse lines. Legs and feet are large and powerful and adapted for predation on fish and other slippery aquatic creatures with the tarsi being bare and the soles of the feet covered with sharp spicules to assist in grasping prey. Juveniles retain most of their pale white down for the first six months of their lives (Kemp 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is considered uncommon but widespread along tropical rivers and other suitable habitat elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa (Fry et al. 1988). Within the region, Pel's Fishing Owl has been found in the north-east of South Africa on the Limpopo, Luvuvhu, Olifants, Sabie and Crocodile rivers in the Lowveld of Limpopo and Mpumalanga as well as on the Pongolo, Mkuze, Mfolozi and uMlalazi rivers, Lake St Lucia and at a number of larger pans in Kwa&#173;Zulu-Natal (Mendelsohn 1997a). Although there are records of vagrant birds from as far south as Cape Town, there are currently no known populations of this species south of Mtunzini (Mendelsohn 1997a). In Swaziland, it was formerly a breeding resident in the Umbuluzi Gorge, and possibly in other river gorges in the Lebombo Mountains, but there have been no confirmed records since the 1984 floods caused by Cyclone Demoina removed all suitable riparian habitat (Parker 1994). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014ai). Mendelsohn (1997a) estimated there to be less than500 pairs in southern Africa, including the stronghold in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Within the region, Brooke (1984) speculated that there may be less than60 mature individuals in South Africa. Barnes and Parker (2000a) modified this estimate to 120-150 mature individuals, of which the majority (c. 60 mature individuals) were within Kruger National Park. Outside of the park, another 10 individuals were thought to occur on the Limpopo River, west of the park boundary, and isolated pairs occurred in the Soutpansberg and Blyde River systems (Barnes and Tarboton 1998). The only recent surveys in Mpumalanga and Limpopo were conducted along two major river systems in Kruger National Park, the Luvuvhu and Olifants (Botha 2010), which documented an estimated 15-25 breeding pairs in the park. Since 2009, additional surveys were conducted on the Olifants River for 50 km to the west of the Kruger National Park, where a further 5-7 breeding pairs were found (Botha 2010). Several resident pairs are also known from along the Limpopo River (AJ Botha unpubl. data). Cyrus (1998) estimated there to be less than60 mature individuals in KwaZulu-Natal. Although regular sightings are reported from sites in northern KwaZulu-Natal, a reliable estimate of the population in that area is not available at present. The regional population is estimated to be c. 70-100 mature individuals. Due to difficulty in obtaining accurate population estimates of this elusive species, confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be stable in the absence of evidence of any declines or substantial threats (BirdLife International 2014ai). The regional population is thought to be in decline, although difficulties in estimating a regional population have hampered attempts to obtain an accurate rate of decline. The regional population is conservatively estimated to be undergoing a continuous population decline of greater than 20% over the past three generations. Confidence in this trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Pel's Fishing Owl is found along river systems, pans and quiet backwaters that are fringed by suitable riparian vegetation, which provides hunting perches, cover and natural cavities in trees that the birds breed in (Mendelsohn 1997a). Breeding in neighbouring Botswana occurs January-June with egg-laying peaking February-April (Skinner 1996), and March-April in northern South Africa (Tarboton et al. 1987). One chick is reared per breeding attempt. The generation length of 3.8 years is the mean of two calculated values derived from published and/or extrapolated estimates of mean age at first breeding, maximum longevity in the wild and mean annual adult survival (BirdLife International 2014ai). Fledglings may wander widely in search of suitable habitat to establish a territory. Adults are resident and territorial, and are usually found in pairs, although birds may move locally or concentrate due to waterbodies drying up, or when extensive flooding destroys riparian vegetation (Irwin 1981, Barnes and Parker 2000a). They usually hunt from a perch over clear water and feed mainly on fish, occasionally on other aquatic vertebrates.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The most significant threat to the species is loss of suitable habitat due to a decline in the quality and quantity of water in rivers and other waterbodies (Barnes and Parker 2000a). This may be a result of water extraction and pollution, due to such activities as water provision to urban settlements, agricultural, industrial and mining activities, and the construction of impoundments within catchments. The species is particularly sensitive to clearing and disturbance of tall riparian fringes (Mendelsohn 1997a). Although the effects of global climate change are difficult to predict, extensive flooding from increased rainfall may destroy riparian vegetation along rivers and make certain areas unsuitable for the species. Similarly, severe drought conditions within the species' range could also significantly reduce the extent of available habitat.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY </h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Birds of Prey Programme of the Endangered Wildlife Trust conducts annual surveys of the population of this species along two of the major river systems in Kruger National Park, and has registered a long-term monitoring project with SANParks in this regard (Botha 2010). Surveys of the Olifants River have been expanded westwards beyond the borders of Kruger National Park, with the support of private land-owners. The Birds of Prey Programme endeavours to create greater awareness of the impact of human activities on the habitat and population of this species and actively engages with stakeholders within the catchments of river systems that could have an impact on water quality and quantity, and riparian habitats. The species is listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No 7 of 2003. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED </h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Conservation interventions required include adequate enforcement of protection of known breeding sites. Regular monitoring of Pel's Fishing Owl populations in northern KwaZulu-Natal is required to accurately determine the regional population and true conservation status of the species. Implementation of an awareness programme throughout the species' range, involving all stakeholders and highlighting threats, is necessary. Appropriate management of catchment areas upstream of protected areas that support this species is essential (Barnes and Parker 2000a). Potential impacts should be considered during assessment of development applications in catchments where this species occurs.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population of the South African endemic Cape Parrot Poicephalus robustus satisfies the criterion for regionally Endangered under C1 (less than2 500 mature individuals, projected to decline by at least 20% over the next two generations).</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">BirdLife International, the custodian of IUCN Red List for birds, does not recognise the Cape Parrot as a distinct species, lumping it together with Brown-necked Parrot P. fuscicollis (BirdLife International 2014 aj). However, it is recognised by BirdLife South Africa and, following a precautionary approach, was included in the 2015 regional assessment.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was previously treated as conspecific with the Grey-headed or Brown-necked Parrot Poicephalus fuscicollis. Clancey's (1997a) proposal was adopted with P. robustus (which is associated with Afromontane forest habitats) as a separate species from P. fuscicollis. This is based on morphological, biogeographical and ecological differences (Wirminghaus et al. 2002, Perrin 2005). The arrangement of P. fuscicollis was revised with two subspecies: P. f. fuscicollis (which historically occurred in west Africa, but is now common only in the Gambia) and P. f. suahelicus, which occurs in low-lying woodland in south-central Africa (Clancey 1997a, Wirminghaus et al. 2002, Perrin 2005), including marginally in north-eastern South Africa.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">30 cm, 300 g. The sexes are dimorphic in plumage. The adult male has a dark earth-brown forecrown with an olive-green crown. The cheeks and ear coverts are olive-green to yellow-green with the lores matt-black while the head feathers have dusky centres. The tail is a dark slate while the back, rump and uppertail coverts are blue-green. The mantle, scapulars and upperwing coverts are dark green, edged paler green. A band of orange-red coverts extends from the carpal joint to the dark slate primaries. The chin and throat are olive-brown and the upper breast is yellow-green. The lower breast, belly, flanks and undertail coverts are blue-green and the thighs orange-red. The bill is coloured old ivory with a narrow, pale grey cere; the legs and feet are blue-grey. The adult female resembles the male, but has varied forecrown plumage patterns, some having orange across the forehead and others none. The juvenile is similar to the adult bird, but both sexes have salmon pink on the forehead in first plumage, the colour extending further back onto the crown than in adult females. Juveniles lack red on tibia or shoulder (Skead 1971, Wirminghaus et al. 2001, 2002).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Cape Parrot is endemic to South Africa, inhabiting isolated patches of Scarp and Southern Mistbelt Forest (Mucina and Rutherford 2006) from Fort Beaufort, Eastern Cape, to Karkloof, KwaZulu-Natal (Downs 2005), with a small, relict population in northern Afrotemperate Forest in the Woodbush/Wolkberg area of Limpopo (Downs and Bowker 2010). Although associated primarily with forest, the species is not confined to it, commuting to other habitats in search of food, including coastal forest and orchards. Important forests in Eastern Cape are the Amatole Forest complex, Port St Johns to Mkambati Nature Reserve, and forests around Umtata and Mt Frere, while in KwaZulu-Natal, forests near Kokstad and Riverside, Creighton, Bulwer, Dargle and Karkloof are important (Downs 2000, Downs 2005, Downs and Bowker 2010, Downs 2011).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Annual censuses over the past 15 years indicate a population size of between 1 100 and 1 500 mature individuals (Downs 2000, Downs 2005, Downs and Bowker 2010, Downs 2011). The proportion of these that are adults, as well as the ratio of males to females, is unknown. Observations of large feeding flocks (up to 180 parrots) in Alice, Eastern Cape, indicate that up to 15% of the population is comprised of sub-adults (SR Boyes unpubl. data). The sub-population in Limpopo (60-80 birds) is isolated from all other Cape Parrot populations further south in KwaZulu-Natal (Downs 2000, Downs 2005, Downs and Bowker 2010, Downs 2011) by a distance of c. 600 km, and gene flow is unlikely to occur between them. The Amatole forests have 500-600 parrots, while the former Transkei and southern KwaZulu-Natal forests each have about 400-500 parrots (Downs 2011). Numbers could decrease rapidly with disease or human exploitation in each of these sub-populations (CT Downs unpubl. data). A regional population of c. 1 250 mature individuals is estimated. The confidence in this population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Cape Parrot population has been stable for the past fifteen years (Downs 2011). Cape Parrots are habitat and food specialists with their preferred habitat being Southern Mistbelt Forests. Continued human impact on indigenous forests, most of which have little visible protection, will have a negative effect, particularly affecting nest site and food availability. Accelerated climate change scenarios of increased droughts are likely to impact negatively on recruitment and fruiting of indigenous forests. Reduced forest fruit availability may stress the birds, causing diseases, such as Beak-and-feather disease. Illegal trade is also a concern, particularly the removal of adult birds which take up to five years to mature. These negative factors may vary in intensity across the distribution range and affect the persistence of sub-populations to varying degrees. Consequently, a conservative estimate of a 20% population reduction is predicted for the next three generations. The confidence in population trend is medium.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Flock size varies with singletons, pairs, or groups of 5-6 birds usually observed. However, at localised food sites, flock size may increase to 20-70 birds, caused by aggregation and giving a false impression of abundance (Wirminghaus et al. 2001). The species breeds in Afromontane forests between 1 000 and 1 400 masl (Skead 1971, Wirminghaus et al. 1999, Downs and Symes 2004). Cape Parrots reach breeding age after four years (Wirminghaus et al. 2001) and nest in secondary cavities in tall, emergent trees (Wirminghaus et al. 2001). A generation length of 10 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014aj) for Brown-necked Parrot. Yellowwood trees, particularly the Outeniqua Yellowwood Afrocarpus falcatus, are important for breeding, foraging and social interactions (Symes et al. 2002, Downs and Bowker 2010). Foraging is concentrated in the first and last few hours of daylight (Wirminghaus et al. 2000).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Factors affecting the decline of Cape Parrots are complex and include forest degradation, food and nest site shortages resulting in poor breeding success, removal of birds from the wild for the avicultural trade, an increasing prevalence of Beak-and-feather-disease, the causative agent of the virulent psittacine beak-and-feather disease in all sub-populations, and predation (Wirminghaus et al. 1999, Downs 2005, Downs and Bowker 2010). Some of these threats will increase in intensity under different climate change scenarios (Downs and Bowker 2010). Certain species-specific factors, such as slow breeding rates, the need for specific breeding sites, and specialised feeding, combine to make it hard for Cape Parrots to survive habitat loss and degradation, disease, and predation (including human removal of adults or chicks from the wild). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Forest degradation has resulted largely from the long history of logging by settlers, recent selective logging and current illegal logging (Wirminghaus et al. 1999). Removal of snags with the resulting loss of nests or potential nest sites (Downs and Symes 2004), changes in quality and availability of forest-food, and pressure on forest fragments in rural areas of Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal (for firewood, grazing, building material and traditional medicine collection; CT Downs pers. obs.) has further exacerbated the degradation of natural forests. Harvesting records from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries for the past five years detail the continued removal of up to 600m3 of Afrocarpus timber per year (SR Boyes unpubl. data).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The occurrence of psittacine beak-and-feather disease among captive parrot populations in South Africa is well documented, but the incidence of the disease in free-living parrot populations in southern African regions remains largely unknown (Heath et al. 2004) and whether the birds are developing an immunity is unclear. However, in 2004 the first confirmed case of the disease in wild parrots in South Africa was reported with the isolation and genetic characterisation of a Beak-and-feather-disease strain from a free-living Cape Parrot (Heath et al. 2004). During 2010-11, there were high infection rates of psittacine beak-and-feather disease at five capture sites in the Amatole region (SR Boyes unpubl. data) and reports of positive birds in KwaZulu-Natal (CT Downs unpubl. data). Previous research on the threat posed by psittacine beak-and-feather disease was dependent on picking up dead birds and was unable to quantify the extent of the problem (Heath et al. 2004, Downs and Bowker 2010, Downs 2011). Cape Parrots, especially juveniles, appear to show symptoms of the disease particularly during periods of food scarcity or extreme cold.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Long-term population monitoring by the annual Cape Parrot Birding Big Day encourages public involvement and conservation of this species (Downs 2011). In addition, a database of Cape Parrot sightings and distribution has been kept (CT Downs unpubl. data). Current research includes conservation of forest habitat, monitoring of food availability, provision of nest boxes, monitoring of the bird trade, monitoring of disease, captive breeding, genetics, and planting of food trees. Educational outreach includes public talks, interactions with schoolchildren, provision of educational posters, DVDs and postcards, electronic websites and newsletters. The Cape Parrot Working Group liaises with researchers, local conservation authorities, aviculturalists and the public, both locally and internationally. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In 2009, the Cape Parrot Project was launched in the Amatole region to mitigate all current threats to Cape Parrots. The Cape Parrot Project is involved in growing indigenous trees, the erection of artificial nest boxes, establishment of micro-nurseries in local villages, and education initiatives through social media, school programs, and community outreach projects, such as the Forest Custodians Programme. The Cape Parrot Project rescues Cape Parrots with advanced psittacine beak-and-feather disease infection, rehabilitates them, and releases them back into the wild. The Cape Parrot is listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No 7 of 2003. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Conservation action for Cape Parrots must include conservation of forest habitat, provision of nest boxes, effective policing of the bird trade, enforcement of TOPS regulations, monitoring of disease and the establishment of protocols for rehabilitation and release of psittacine beak-and-feather disease-positive Cape Parrots. A captive-breeding pro&#173;gramme is needed to supply the aviculturalist demand and prevent further removal of birds from the wild. Population monitoring undertaken through the Cape Parrot Birding Big Day should continue. Some Afromontane forests where Cape Parrots occur are only partially protected and are privately owned; their conservation status should be elevated. Those in KwaZulu-Natal that have Cape Parrots resident or visiting regularly have been listed as part of the KwaZulu-Natal Mistbelt Forests (IBA SA071). Important forests around Mthatha and Port St Johns in the former Transkei were, however, omitted from the IBA network and their eligibility should be reviewed.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the iconic African Penguin Spheniscus demersus has fallen dramatically, to the extent that it now satisfies the population size reduction criterion of A2 for regionally Endangered, with a reduction of greater than 50% over a three generation period, where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible). In addition, it is suspected that this decline will continue into the future satisfying criteria A3 and A4.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Penguin breeds only in South Africa and Namibia, and a large proportion of its global range occurs in the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000, and is listed as globally Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">55-65 cm, 2.9-3.5 kg. With the exception of moulting vagrants of other species, the only penguin occurring on the African mainland. Adults are black above with mostly white below with a broad black breast-band with unique spot patterns on the breast and belly. The face is black with a patch of naked pink skin above the eye. Juveniles are initially blue-grey above and paler below, becoming brown in their second and third years (Crawford and Whittington 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">African Penguins are near-endemic to the region, occurring in breeding colonies from Hollam's Bird Island in Namibia to Bird Island (Algoa Bay, Eastern Cape) in South Africa (Crawford et al. 2011). Within the region, they breed at 15 islands and two mainland sites. Breeding ceased at Bird Island in Lambert's Bay in 2006 (Crawford et al. 2008b). Penguins attempted to breed at De Hoop Nature Reserve, Western Cape, from 2003 to 2005, but failed owing to high levels of mammalian predation (Crawford et al. 2011). Outside of the breeding season, the species ranges coastally between 18°S in Namibia and 29°S in KwaZulu-Natal. There have been sightings as far north as Sette Cama, Gabon and the Limpopo River mouth, Mozambique (Crawford and Whittington 2005). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population was estimated at 52 000 individuals or 26 000 pairs in 2009, which included Namibian birds (Crawford et al. 2011). The regional population is approximately 40 000 mature individuals (Crawford et al. 2012a). The confidence in this estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In Western Cape, the population increased during the first few years of this century to 34 749 pairs and then decreased to 11 000 pairs in 2009 (Crawford et al. 2011) and fell again to 8 780 pairs in 2011 (Crawford et al. 2012a). In Eastern Cape, the numbers of breeding pairs halved from an average of 21 175 from 1993-2001 to an average of 10 057 over 1993-2010 (Crawford et al. 2011). This population increased slightly to 11 300 in 2011 (Crawford et al. 2011). The regional population decreased from 56 000 pairs in 2001 to 21 000 pairs in 2009 (Crawford et al. 2011) and decreased further to just over 20 000 in 2011 (Crawford et al. 2012a). The confidence in this regional trend estimate is high. The rate of decrease of the population has increased rapidly over the past 10 years (approximately 6.4% per year). If the population continues to decrease at the same rate, this species will become a candidate for uplisting to Critically Endangered in the near future.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">African Penguins forage for small pelagic fish in inshore waters, usually within 15 km of the coast and can travel up to 50 km from colonies while breeding (Petersen et al. 2006, Pichegru et al. 2010a). Outside of the breeding season, they can move further offshore, especially when foraging on the Agulhas Bank off the south coast of South Africa (BirdLife South Africa, unpubl. data, Crawford et al. 2008b). Juveniles are typically far-ranging and can move up to 1 800 km from their natal colony, although they tend to recruit to natal colonies. However, juveniles may recruit away from their natal colonies, a phenomenon believed to be linked to prey availability during prospecting for recruitment sites (Crawford and Whittington 2005). Adults tend to remain within 400 km of their breeding islands (BirdLife South Africa, unpubl. data, Randall et al. 1987). The species breeds and moults on coastal islands and protected mainland sites (Crawford et al. 2011). Breeding colonies are usually flat and sandy with varying degrees of vegetation cover although birds can also breed at steep, rocky sites (e.g. St Croix Island). They breed colonially and year-round, although there are clearly defined peaks, usually in winter (Crawford and Whittington 2005). The generation time of 9.3 years was based on an estimate of mean age at first breeding and a published estimate of mean annual survival (BirdLife International 2014ak).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is subject to a broad array of threats across its range. The current population decline has been attributed primarily to a lack of food. There is increasing evidence that fish availability during different times of year affects breeding success and adult survival (Crawford et al. 2011). A shift in distribution of Sardine Sardinops sagax and Anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus stocks from the West Coast eastwards to the southern Western Cape, away from the major penguin colonies, is the probable cause of fish shortages (Roy et al. 2007). Competition for these stocks from the commercial purse-seine fishery has also been implicated (Coetzee et al. 2008). Birds are threatened when at sea from oil spills, which can cause significant mortality of both oiled birds and abandoned chicks and eggs (Adams 1994, Crawford et al. 2000). Potential for catastrophic large-scale oil spills is likely to increase, given further developments planned along the coast. Chronic oiling from leaking wrecks, washing of ship's tanks and other sources is also a threat (Wolfaardt et al. 2009). Cape Fur Seal Arctocephalus pusillus predation is a major cause of mortality at some colonies, especially Dyer Island (Kirkman 2009). Seals have also displaced penguins from some breeding sites (Kirkman 2009). Other lesser threats are more specific to certain colonies. Disturbance and trampling of nests by tourists in the area surrounding the Boulders Beach colony on the Cape Peninsula was a problem, although this is being addressed by authorities. Collision with vehicles is a problem at both Robben Island and Boulders Beach (du Toit et al. 2003). Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus predation occurs in most colonies and can reduce breeding success by half (du Toit et al. 2003, Pichegru 2013). The impacts of gull predation will likely increase because the gull population around the South African coast has also increased in recent years (Crawford et al. 2012a). Great White Pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus predation may be more of a problem at Dassen and Jutten islands than previously realised. There was certainly some evidence of this early in 2012 at Jutten Island (BM Dyer pers. comm.). Although the removal of guano from breeding islands has stopped, the lack of guano in which to create burrows continues to have an effect: at some colonies penguins nest on the surface, exposing their eggs and chicks to temperature extremes and predation (du Toit et al. 2003, Pichegru 2013).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Biodiversity Management Plan (MP) for the African Penguin was initiated in November 2010 by CapeNature and the Department of Environmental Affairs. It outlines the major threats and specifies what actions need to be taken to mitigate these (Waller 2011). Oiled penguins are rehabilitated and released successfully by various rehabilitation centres, including the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds, the South African Marine Rehabilitation and Education Centre, and Penguins Eastern Cape. There is little difference in the survival rates of oiled birds that have been rehabilitated and unoiled birds (Underhill et al. 1999), but the long-term breeding success may be diminished for oiled birds (Wolfaardt et al. 2009). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Monitoring of population size and breeding success is conducted at most breeding colonies by the Department of Environmental Affairs, CapeNature, Robben Island Museums, Percy FitzPatrick Institute and Animal Demography Unit. Fibreglass nest boxes have been provided at colonies affected by the lack of guano, and were thought to improve breeding success (Kemper et al. 2007). However, these boxes can overheat and reduce hatching success by at least one third compared to natural burrows (Pichegru et al. 2012). Wooden frames or concrete burrows can increase breeding success compared to open nests (Pichegru et al. 2012). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Feral cats, which can have significant impacts on chicks in particular, have been almost entirely eliminated from Robben Island. Kelp Gull numbers are controlled by SANParks at Bird Island. Measures have been put in place by CapeNature to deal with Kelp Gull numbers and Cape Fur Seal predation at Dyer Island. Cape Fur Seals, implicated in penguin predation, are controlled at Dyer Island, but not at other islands where seal predation is a problem, such as Dassen and Robben islands and islands in Saldanha Bay. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">All but two colonies are formally protected as provincial nature reserves, national parks or cultural heritage sites and the collection of penguin eggs and guano is prohibited. The African Penguin is listed nationally on the Threatened or Protected Species (TOPS) Regulations and the Western Cape Provincial Ordinance. Internationally, this species is listed on CITES Appendix II and Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Appendix II).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As outlined above, a number of conservation and monitoring initiatives are already in place to conserve this iconic near-endemic species. Continuous monitoring of the regional and global population is imperative, taking into account recommendations that will emanate from the Biodiversity Management Plan.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The possibility of exclusion of purse-seine fishing around breeding colonies should be investigated as this is deemed to pose a threat to penguins in terms of competition for food. Prevention of oil pollution by tighter control over the cleaning of ships' tanks and at oil offloading terminals in Cape Town, Saldanha and possibly Coega should be exercised.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Predation by gulls and seals should be monitored at all penguin colonies, and mitigation measures should be implemented where required. In the case of seals, removal of a small number of individuals seen to be predating on seabirds is a solution. Growing numbers of seals also compete with penguins and other seabirds for food and space, and a solution to this problem should be sought.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Penguin breeding habitat should be improved and increased, through research into suitability of artificial nesting shelters, and ways of excluding predators. It is recommended that tighter control of research permits be maintained to limit disturbance at penguin colonies, particularly those at offshore islands. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A different suite of challenges come into play where penguins come into regular contact with humans, such as at the Boulders and Stony Point colonies. In such locations novel measures have been put into place to safeguard penguins, e.g. provision of shelter and restricting human access to boardwalks. Efforts should be made to maintain and upgrade such measures. Mainland colonies provide valuable opportunities for raising awareness, promoting sustainable ecotourism and raising funds for penguin conservation. </p>

<div id="_idContainer485" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Prince Edward Islands population of Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua satisfied criterion A2, with a measured population decreases of 74% not having ceased, the causes of decrease not being fully understood and possibly not reversible. In 2012, the number of mature birds at the Prince Edward Islands was probably less than2 500 mature individuals and has decreased by greater than 20% in two generations, satisfying the criterion for regionally Endangered under criterion C1.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was listed as Near Threatened in the 2000 assessment and is listed as globally Near Threatened. It breeds on the Prince Edward Islands.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Gentoo Penguin shares the genus Pygoscelis with the Chinstrap Penguin P. antarcticus and Adélie Penguin P. adeliae. There are two subspecies of the Gentoo Penguin (Stonehouse 1970, Lynch 2013): the smaller P. p. ellsworthi breeds on the Antarctic Peninsula and at the South Shetland, South Orkney and South Sandwich island groups in the south-west Atlantic Ocean. The larger, nominate subspecies breeds further north at Martillo Island, Tierra del Fuego (southern South America), at the Falkland Islands and South Georgia in the south-west Atlantic Ocean, at Subantarctic island groups (Prince Edward, Crozet, Kerguelen, Heard) in the south Indian Ocean and at Macquarie Island south-east of Australia (Lynch 2013).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">51-90 cm; 5-5.5 kg. The world's third largest penguin, although body size is variable across its range. Males are larger than females. Face, head and back black. Flippers have a narrow white trailing edge on the upper surface and a dark tip on the underside. Tail is long and black. Conspicuous, but variable, white ear-patches above eyes, typically meeting across the crown. Variable amounts of white filoplumes are present on the head. The bill is bright red-orange with black along the upper mandible and at the tip. Eye brown. Feet bright orange with black nails. Juveniles are similarly marked except for greyer eyes and lack of distinct white ear patches and filoplumes (Ryan 2005h, Lynch 2013).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Gentoo Penguin has a circumpolar breeding distribution that ranges in latitude from Cape Tuxon on the Antarctic Peninsula (65°16'S) to the Crozet Islands (46°00'S) (Lynch 2013). The Prince Edward Islands, together with the Crozet Islands, are at the northern extremity of the species' range (Marchant and Higgins 1990).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is c. 387 000 pairs (Lynch 2013). In 2012, 556 pairs of Gentoo Penguin were counted breeding at Marion Island; the estimate of numbers breeding from a model fitted to annual counts was 767 pairs (Department of Environmental Affairs unpubl. data). In 2003, an estimated 475 pairs bred at Prince Edward Island (Ryan et al. 2003). The overall population of Gentoo Penguins at the Prince Edward Islands in 2012 was estimated at 1 031-1 242 pairs or 2 062-2 484 breeding individuals. Confidence in this population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Global populations are thought to have decreased substantially, although fluctuations make it difficult to ascertain long-term trends (Lynch 2013). At Marion Island, 1 345 pairs of Gentoo Penguin bred during 1974-1977 (Siegfried et al. 1978) and 888 pairs in 1984 (Adams and Wilson 1987). Numbers breeding at Marion Island have been counted annually since 1994 (Huyser 2000b). About 1 350 pairs bred in 1994 and 1995. This decreased to less than800 pairs in 2003, and then increased to c. 1 100 pairs in 2008 (Crawford et al. 2003c, 2009c). Numbers subsequently decreased to 556 pairs in 2012, the lowest value yet recorded (Department of Environmental Affairs, unpubl. data). Overall, numbers of Gentoo Penguins breeding at Marion Island decreased by 52% between 1994 and 2012, a period of 18 years or 2.1 generations. This is equivalent to 74% in three generations. Confidence in this population trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At the northern reaches of their range, Gentoo Penguins breed in small colonies that have nests well spaced out. Nests are made with grasses, especially Poa cooki and Cotula plumbens as well as mosses (BM Dyer pers. obs.). Clutches have two eggs and incubation is by both parents. Breeding at Marion Island commences in mid-winter and is mostly complete by the end of December with laying being recorded from early June until early November (Crawford et al. 2003c). At Marion Island, breeding success has shown substantial variability, ranging from nearly complete failure to an average production of almost one chick per pair (Crawford et al. 2003c, 2009c). Late arrivals risk breeding failure because eggs and small chicks are vulnerable to Subantarctic Skuas Stercorarius antarcticus that return to the island in late August (Crawford et al. 2003c). Re-layers may be more successful because after Eudyptes penguins arrive to breed, skuas feed on their eggs. Gentoo Penguins can breed as early as two years old and most are breeding by 3-4 years (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Relatively large annual fluctuations in numbers breeding at a given site are probably related to absenteeism from breeding among mature individuals and delayed recruitment of first-time breeders (Croxall and Rothery 1995, Lynch 2013). At the Crozet Islands, Gentoo Penguins breeding late in one year, often either did not breed or had their breeding delayed in the following year (Bost and Jouventin 1990). Gentoo Penguins forage inshore around their breeding colonies, feeding predominantly on crustaceans, fish, and squid, but with considerable variation in the diet between years and among the different localities at which they breed (Lynch 2013). In September and October 1984 at Marion Island, 82% of all foraging trips of Gentoo Penguins were less than 40 km (Adams and Wilson 1987). In 1984-1985 at Marion Island, fish accounted for 53% of their diet by mass (juvenile Nototheniidae 39%, Myctophidae 8%), crustaceans 45% (decapod shrimp Nauticaris marionis 26%, pelagic euphausiid Euphausia vallentini 19%) and cephalopods 2% (mostly octopods) (Adams and Wilson 1987). The occurrence of demersal and benthic prey in the diet of Gentoo Penguins at Marion Island suggests that they feed close to the seabed (Adams and Wilson 1987).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At Marion Island, compared to other localities, the population, breeding success and meal size of Gentoo Penguins are small and the breeding season is protracted, suggesting numbers are limited by food (Adams and Klages 1989). Food availability may be influenced by environmental factors and probably affects onset of breeding and breeding success, which in instances has been too low to sustain the population of Gentoo Penguins at Marion Island (Crawford et al. 2003c). A recent decrease in Gentoo Penguins at Iles Kerguelen is likely related to reduced food availability (Lescroël and Bost 2006). Growing populations of Antarctic Fur Seals Arctocephalus gazella at Marion and Prince Edward islands (Bester et al. 2009) may inflict increased mortality on Gentoo Penguins. Subantarctic Skuas Stercorarius antarcticus and both species of giant petrels Macronectes spp. also prey on adults, eggs or chicks (Crawford et al. 2003c, BM Dyer pers. obs.). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At Marion Island, Gentoo Penguins are easily disturbed by humans (Crawford et al. 2003c), less so at Prince Edward Island where visitor numbers are extremely tightly controlled and are kept very low and infrequent. Abandonment of nests may result in eggs and young chicks dying from exposure or being taken by skuas, giant petrels or Lesser Sheathbills Chionis minor. By comparison, in maritime Antarctica, parties of visitors in the vicinity of a Gentoo Penguin colony did not influence predatory behaviour of skuas (Crosbie et al. 1999). Disease has caused sometimes heavy mortality of two other species of penguin at Marion Island (Cooper et al. 2009). Climate change could reduce the suitability of northern localities such as the Prince Edward Islands for breeding by Gentoo Penguins, whereas populations are expanding southwards and increasing at the southern extreme of their distribution (Lynch et al. 2008). Finally, Gentoo Penguins could be badly affected by oil spills.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At Marion Island, breeding sites of Gentoo Penguins are listed according to the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan as Zone 4: the strictest conservation area, with no helicopter movement permitted overhead, no casual access and only limited research allowed. There are strict guidelines in place for offloading diesel. No access is allowed to Prince Edward Island except for bona fide research and conservation purposes every 4-5 years. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Best-practice guidelines for reducing risk of disease outbreaks at islands are being developed by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels. Overwintering teams should be given basic training in the rescue and rehabilitation of oiled penguins. The impact of any proposed fishery on the prey of Gentoo Penguins should be carefully assessed before such a fishery is allowed. Consideration should be given to declaring marine protected areas at important feeding grounds of Gentoo Penguins.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Southern Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes chrysocome at the Prince Edward Islands underwent an observed decline of greater than 50% over three generations satisfying the criterion A2 for regionally Endangered. Furthermore this decline is predicted to continue over the next three generations.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the Prince Edward Islands. In addition, the species was listed as Near Threatened in the 2000 regional assessment and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">E. chrysocome (s.l.) was split into Southern Rockhopper E. chrysocome and Northern Rockhopper E. moseleyi penguins following Jouventin et al. (2006) based on morphological, vocal and genetic differences. E. chrysocome (s.s.) is considered polytypic, with two races: the nominate chrysocome breeds from Cape Horn to the Falkland Islands, while filholi breeds on various Subantarctic islands. Although filholi has been proposed as a further split from E. chrysocome, this taxon is not currently split by BirdLife International (2014al).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">55 cm, 3.35 kg. A robust penguin with white underparts and blue-black or slate-grey upperparts. A straight yellow eyebrow, ending in sideways projecting yellow plumes, does not meet between the eyes. The pink fleshy gape and bare pink skin continue down the underside of the lower mandible. Eyes red. Short bill (larger in males than females) reddish brown. Feet pink. Immature birds have only a narrow supercilium and a pale mottled grey chin. Juveniles are similarly marked but differ in having greyer eyes and lacking distinct crest feathers. The Southern Rockhopper Penguin differs from the Northern Rockhopper Penguin in having a narrower supercilium, shorter plumes reaching just over the black throat, and less extensive markings on the underside of the flippers at their tips (BirdLife International 2014al).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The subspecies E. c. chrysocome occurs in southern Chile, Argentina, at the Falkland Islands and South Georgia in the south-west Atlantic Ocean. E. c. filholi occurs at the Prince Edward Islands, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands and Heard Island in the south Indian Ocean and at Macquarie, Campbell, Antipodes and Auckland islands in the south-west Pacific Ocean. Its latitudinal range for breeding varies from 46° S at the Crozet Islands to 54° S at Macquarie Island (BirdLife International 2014al).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at 1 000 000-2 499 999 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014al). In 2012/13, 65 000 pairs of Southern Rockhopper Penguins were counted at Marion Island, compared to 173 000 pairs in 1994/95 (Department of Environmental Affairs, unpubl. data). An estimated 38 000 pairs bred at Prince Edward Island in 2008 (Crawford et al. 2009c). Combined, the overall population at the Prince Edward Islands is of the order of 94 000-103 000 pairs. Confidence in this population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to have undergone a decline of c. 30% over the last three generations (30 years), which has been driven largely by the declines in the Falklands (where data are most complete), and to a lesser extent, Marion Island (BirdLife International 2014al). In 1987/88, 137 652 pairs of Southern Rockhopper Penguins were counted at Marion Island, increasing to 173 000 pairs in 1994/95. This fell to c. 61 000 pairs in 2008/09 (Crawford et al. 2003e, Crawford et al. 2009c). Just 56 000 pairs were counted in 2009/10 (Department of Environmental Affairs unpubl. data). Between 1994/95 and 2012/13, nine whole-island counts of Southern Rockhopper Penguins at Marion Island indicated a significant decrease in the population (Department of Environmental Affairs, unpubl. data). At Prince Edward Island, counts of Southern Rockhopper Penguins decreased from 45 000 pairs in 2001 to 38 000 pairs in 2008, despite better coverage in the latter period (BirdLife International 2014al). The decrease in counts between 1987/88 and 2012/13 was 52% in 25 years, equivalent to 72% over three generations. Confidence in this population trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">From late October, Southern Rockhopper Penguins return to their breeding colonies at Marion Island, which range from sea-level sites to cliff-tops. Males arrive at colonies for breeding several days earlier than the females (Crawford et al. 2003e, 2006). Pairs lay two eggs from late November to early December, the first egg being smaller than the second egg (Williams 1980b). The incubation period is 36-38 days (Williams 1980b) and the fledging period is about 70 days (Marchant and Higgins 1990). At most breeding sites, including the Prince Edward Islands, only one chick is fledged by each successful pair (Williams 1980b). From February to mid-March, the chicks fledge and depart the colony (Crawford et al. 2003e). After breeding, adult Southern Rockhopper Penguins go to sea to gain weight for about a month before returning to their islands to moult. They remain ashore for 20-30 days to replace all their feathers (Brown 1986), before departing for the winter period. Southern Rockhopper Penguins are opportunistic feeders, preying on a variety of crustaceans, fish and cephalopods (Crawford et al. 2003e). During the breeding seasons of 1983/84-1985/86, crustaceans, mainly the decapod shrimp Nauticaris marionis and the pelagic euphausiid Euphausia vallentini, constituted 85% by mass of the food at Marion Island (Brown and Klages 1987). Since 1994/95, N. marionis has been less important in the diet at Marion Island, whereas the euphausiid Thyssanoesa vicina has become an important prey item (Department of Environmental Affairs, unpubl. data).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Inadequate breeding success has been a major factor driving the decrease of Southern Rockhopper Penguins at Marion Island (Crawford et al. 2003e). Overwintering conditions are thought to influence the proportions of penguins skipping breeding, and breeding success, at Marion Island (Crawford et al. 2006). In winter, penguins from Marion Island forage mostly to the north-east of the island. Mass of individual birds returning to Marion Island to breed decreased by about 20% between 1994/95 and 2007/08 and was significantly correlated with breeding success (Crawford et al. 2008c) and global climate change may have altered availability of prey to rockhopper penguins (Cunningham and Moors 1994, Guinard et al. 1998). In 1992, 1993 and 2004, disease, including avian cholera Pasteurella multocida, killed substantial numbers of King Penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus and Macaroni Penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus at Marion Island (Cooper et al. 2009). Avian cholera also caused deaths of Southern Rockhopper Penguins at Campbell Island (Cunningham and Moors 1994). There have been large decreases of Southern Rockhopper Penguins at Campbell Island in the south-west Pacific Ocean (Cunningham and Moors 1994) and at the Falkland Islands in the south-west Atlantic Ocean (Pütz et al. 2003) but the ecological and demographic drivers of rockhopper penguin decreases are not fully understood (BirdLife International 2014al). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At the Falkland Islands, fisheries may have reduced quantities of fish and squid available to Southern Rockhopper Penguins (Bingham 2002). Starvation and poisoning from harmful algal blooms may cause die-offs of rockhopper penguins (BirdLife International 2014al). An oil spill killed substantial numbers of Northern Rockhopper Penguins at Nightingale Island (Tristan da Cunha Islands) in 2011. There is some indication that rockhopper penguins have declined at several sites where there have been major recoveries of fur seals Arctocephalus spp. (BirdLife International 2014al). Recoveries of fur seals at the Prince Edward Islands (Bester et al. 2009) could increase competition for prey and predation of penguins. Giant petrels Macronectes spp., Subantarctic Skuas Stercorarius antarcticus and Lesser Sheathbills Chionis minor also may inflict mortality (BM Dyer pers. obs.).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At Marion Island, there are strict guidelines in place for offloading diesel. Poultry products supplied to the over-wintering teams at Marion Island, or used during relief voyages to the island, do not contain bones and are irradiated in order to reduce the risk of introducing avian diseases. A contingency plan is in place to guide responses to outbreaks of disease at the Prince Edward Islands. No access is allowed to Prince Edward Island except for bona fide research and conservation purposes every 4-5 years. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Monitoring of population numbers and demographic, diet and condition parameters at Marion Island should be continued. A population census at Prince Edward Island should be undertaken at intervals of about five years. Best-practice guidelines for reducing risk of disease outbreaks at islands are being developed by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels. Once available, these guidelines should replace those presently operating at the Prince Edward Islands. Overwintering teams should be given basic training in the rescue and rehabilitation of oiled penguins. The impact of any proposed fishery on the prey of Southern Rockhopper Penguins should be carefully assessed before such a fishery is allowed. Consideration should be given to declaring marine protected areas at important feeding grounds of Southern Rockhopper Penguins.</p>

</div>

<div id="_idContainer512" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon Columba delegorguei satisfies the population size criterion of D1 for regionally Endangered (population size estimated to number less than250 mature individuals). In addition, the species' EoO is less than500 km2 and there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of the habitat in which it occurs.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution falls within the region. In addition, the species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two subspecies are recognised. The nominate delegorguei occurs within the region, from KwaZulu-Natal north to eastern Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi. A second subspecies, sharpei, extends northwards to Kenya, Uganda and South Sudan (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Given the highly fragmented nature of the species' distribution, a detailed taxonomic investigation is recommended (Nuttall 2000).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">28-30 cm, 160 g. A large, dark, forest canopy pigeon. Sexes differ in coloration. Adult males have dark brown backs, with dark grey tails. The belly and undertail coverts are dark grey. The breast is pinkish brown, while the throat is dark grey with a slight pinkish sheen. The head is slate grey with iridescent pink, mauve and green highlights; the mantle has a white collar. The bill is dark grey with a horn-coloured tip. The eyes are dark brown with a pinkish grey eye-ring. Legs and feet are bright red. Adult females are similar but lack the white collar, and have less iridescent heads (Dean 2005d).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species has an extremely fragmented distribution throughout Africa, being restricted to remnant forest patches (Dean 2005d). The nominate subspecies occurs to eastern Zimbabwe, central Mozambique and eastern South Africa. Within the region, it is restricted to Mistbelt and Coastal Scarp forests in KwaZulu-Natal and, historically, Eastern Cape. Currently, breeding is thought to be restricted to Ngoye Forest Reserve, Dhlinza Forest Nature Reserve, Entumeni Nature Reserve, Karkloof and Nkandla forests (Nuttall 2000). The combined area of these reserves is 89 km2. As is typical of frugivorous pigeons, the species is nomadic in response to food sources and is likely to move between these and other forests (Dean 2005d). Records from Lusikisiki and Port St Johns in Eastern Cape, and iSimangaliso Wetland Park and uMlalazi Nature Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal indicate that individuals do leave their core areas, possibly in search of food (Quickelberge 1989, Nuttall 2000). The species has undergone a considerable contraction in range over the past 70 years (Nuttall 2000). It no longer occurs at Pigeon Valley, Durban, the locality at which the type specimen was collected, nor in the Bulwer, Dargle and Richmond districts of KwaZulu-Natal where it was formerly considered common by Clancey (1964).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014am). Although it was described as common throughout its range (Gibbs 2001), Baptista et al. (1997) made mention that it is rare and possibly threatened in South Africa. Nuttall (2000) provided no regional estimate, but mentioned that the population estimate of 400-700 mature individuals derived from Johnson et al. (1998) was possibly too high and should be considered a maximum. The diagnostic calls of displaying males during summer may be suggestive of a greater number of birds than is actually present (Nuttall 2000). In addition, the species occurs at low densities within apparently suitable habitat, which is becoming increasingly limited. Based upon this, as well as anecdotal evidence (HN Chittenden pers. comm.), the regional population is estimated to be between 150-200 mature individuals. Confidence in this regional population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to be stable in absence of any evidence indicating declines (BirdLife International 2014am). Little is known of trends affecting the regional population, and therefore a similar assumption is made. Confidence in this regional population trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon is a canopy species restricted to climax Coastal Scarp and Mistbelt forests. It is primarily a fruit eater, including fruits of various Ficus spp., Trema orientalis, Podocarpus latifolius, Macaranga capensis and Phialodiscus zambesias. The species is occasionally found in plantations (Pinus spp.) and gardens (Dean 2005d).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat facing the Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon is loss of habitat, which has led to fragmentation of forests (Nuttall 2000). Destruction of forests since the 1700s for urban development, commercial plantations and agriculture (Geldenhuys and MacDevette 1989) has resulted in severe fragmentation, creating forest ‘islands' which may threaten the viability of small populations of forest taxa, including forest birds such as Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon. Increased demand for traditional medicines is also threatening forests, due to debarking and consequent death of certain tree species. Cattle grazing within forests, which ultimately changes the species composition of forests, is considered a threat (Nuttall 2000).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No specific conservation measures are underway. Ngoye, Dhlinza, Entumeni, Karkloof and Nkandla forests, the core of the species' range in the region, are all listed as Provincial Nature Reserves under the administration of Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife. However, inadequate resources are currently available for the reserve's management.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Annual monitoring of populations at key sites is required. Strict enforcement of conservation regulations in nature reserves needs to be maintained and forest management improved, including an immediate reduction in illegal forest utilisation. </p>

<div id="_idContainer523" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Subantarctic Skua Stercorarius antarcticus has undergone a population decline of greater than 50% of the past three generations satisfying criterion A2. In addition, the species is restricted to two locations in the region satisfying criterion D2.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the Prince Edward Islands and occurs within 200 nm of South Africa.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The taxonomy of skuas is challenging, and authorities differ substantially. Some revisions subsume the genus Catharacta into Stercorarius (Chu et al. 2009), as followed here; alternatively, the large, heavily built skuas are retained in Catharacta, apart from the smaller, slimmer Stercorarius jaegers. The specific epithet antarcticus (or antarctica) for the Subantarctic Skua can add to confusion, because it is not strictly an Antarctic species. Within the antarcticus-complex there are many forms or subspecies, with hamiltoni from the Tristan group and lonnbergi from the Prince Edward Islands, French islands and Bouvet Island being the most likely to be found in South African waters. The alternative name Brown Skua is commonly used for this species. Hybridisation between this and South Polar Skuas S. maccormicki occurs at some peri-Antarctic islands (Ritz et al. 2006).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">61-66 cm, 1.6 kg. A large, robust, heavy-billed skua. Sexes alike although the females are slightly larger than males. Adult dark brown, variably mottled or streaked, especially on mantle, scapulars and flanks. Remiges blackish brown above, dark grey below. Outer 6-10 primaries have white shafts and bases forming a white flash on upper- and underwing. Underparts vary considerably in colour and markings: from uniform brown to extensively blonde-fringed. Bill blackish-grey. Eyes dark brown. Legs and feet blackish. Juvenile similar to adult but more uniform chocolate brown with smaller, more defined white ‘fingers' in the spread wing. Bill grey, tipped black (Wanless and Ryan 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Subantarctic Skuas breed on the Antarctic Peninsula as well as several Subantarctic islands including the Prince Edward Islands (Hemmings 1994, Barnes and Huyser 1998, Wanless and Ryan 2005). Birds are distributed along the coastal areas of Marion Island with ‘clubs' containing non-breeding and immature birds, often in close proximity to penguin colonies (Cerfonteyn 2013). Non-breeding birds disperse throughout the Southern Ocean (Wanless and Ryan 2005). Birds are present throughout the year on the trawling grounds off the Western Cape although the species is more abundant during the winter months (Sinclair 1980, Ryan 1997c). It is scarce in oceanic waters but often occurs close inshore (Ryan 1997c).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at between 6 000 and 15 000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014an). Within South African waters, Crawford et al. (1991) estimated there to be c. 12 500 birds present in winter and c. 4 000 in summer. 450 pairs were reported on Marion Island in 2010/2011 by Cerfonteyn (2013) with a further 267 pairs on Prince Edward Island (Ryan et al. 2009b) giving a an estimated total of 717 pairs on the Prince Edward Islands. Confidence in the population breeding on the Prince Edward Islands is high. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be stable in the absence of evidence for any declines or substantial threats (BirdLife International 2014an). However, the regional population has undergone a drastic decline. Following the eradication of feral cats in 1991, the Marion Island population decreased from 878 pairs in 1987/1988 (Hunter 1990) to 282 pairs in 2008/09 2009 (Ryan et al. 2009b). This trend appears to be counter-intuitive, but may suggest that predation by mice, which were in turn suppressed by cats, may have a more severe effect on burrowing petrels (an important food source for skuas) than initially thought. In 2010/2011 450 pairs were reported on Marion Island by Cerfonteyn (2013). Ryan et al. (2009b) reported a decline of 5% per year on Marion Island although Cerfonteyn (2013) reports a less marked decline of 3% per year. The breeding population on Prince Edward Island appears to be stable (Ryan et al. 2009b). The regional population (birds breeding on the Prince Edward Islands) is estimated to have declined by 62.2% over a three generation period (51.3 years). Confidence in this trend estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Birds on Marion Island breed in open territories (Cerfonteyn 2013), laying two eggs between October and December (Williams 1980a). Fledglings leave their natal colonies for 3-4 years before returning to join non-breeding birds (immature and non-breeding adult birds) at so-called ‘club' sites (Burton 1968). A generation length of 17.1 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014an). Skuas are adaptable and opportunistic predators that employ a variety of foraging methods to target a wide diversity of prey types (Cerfonteyn 2013). The Marion Island population's main sources of food are the penguin colonies as well as, to a lesser extent, burrowing petrels (Sinclair 1980). In addition, skuas from this population scavenge from carcasses of Elephant Seals Mirounga leonine, King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus, Southern Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes chrysocome, Macaroni Penguin E. chrysolophus and Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua (Ryan et al. 2009b). In contrast, Prince Edward Island birds rely heavily on petrels which make up 96% of their diet (Ryan et al. 2009b). Within South African waters, Subantarctic Skuas are predominantly scavengers, foraging amongst albatrosses and petrels behind trawlers (Sinclair 1978). They have also been recorded kleptoparasitising smaller seabirds, harassing them and forcing them to regurgitate (Sinclair 1978). At-sea diet includes fish, squid, crustaceans, molluscs and rarely, seabirds (Wanless and Ryan 2005). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Subantarctic Skuas do not face many threats. They have been recorded being caught in pelagic longline and demersal trawl fisheries off South Africa (Watkins et al. 2008, Petersen et al. 2009a,b, Maree et al. 2014), but not in significant numbers. In addition, this threat will probably be ameliorated by mitigation measures to protect albatrosses and other species. Predation by cats on the Marion Island burrowing petrel population negatively impacted the breeding population of Subantarctic Skua as burrowing petrels are a major food source for breeding skuas (Hunter 1990); however, skua numbers crashed after cats were eradicated from the island. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No access is allowed to Prince Edward Island except for research purposes every 4-5 years. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and are managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. It has been suggested that should a mouse eradication programme be undertaken at Marion Island, it could cause significant mortality of skuas due to secondary poisoning (Wanless et al. 2010). Even in the extremely unlikely event of local extinction at Marion Island arising from mouse eradication work, birds from Prince Edward Island would recolonise Marion Island. Nevertheless, efforts to remove mouse carcasses, and to treat poisoned skuas should be considered to limit mortality as far as possible.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Saddle-billed Stork Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis satisfies criterion D for regionally Endangered (population size less than250 mature individuals).</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this species occurs within the area. In addition, the Saddle-billed Stork was listed as regionally Endangered in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">150 cm, 7 kg. Pied plumage coupled with long, multi-coloured bill and long legs make the adults unmistakeable. Sexes are distinguished by the larger size and dark brown iris of males (yellow in female). Yellow to orange-red wattles at the base of the bill may be present or absent in both sexes. Juveniles are duller than adults with dark grey plumage in areas that are black in adults, and pale grey in areas that are white. Little red is initially evident on the bill or legs in the first year, but this appears from the second year, when the saddle on the bill, which is dull yellow in colour, also becomes evident (Hancock et al. 2010).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Saddle-billed Storks occur in suitable habitat throughout sub-Saharan Africa (del Hoyo et al. 1992), but in South Africa (at the southernmost extreme of the global range), the species is restricted to subtropical areas in association with large, perennial rivers and other waterbodies (Benn 1997). Kruger National Park and adjacent areas (IBA SA002) form the core of the species' range in the region, together with three Zululand IBAs namely iSimangaliso Wetland Park (IBA SA058), Mkuze Game Reserve (IBA SA057) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (IBA SA060). Birds are also resident along the Limpopo River, west of Kruger National Park. In Swaziland, Parker (1994) mentioned that the species occurred sparsely in the Mbuluzi River system in the north-east of the country. Adults tend to be resident with no evidence of seasonal movements (Benn 1997) but immatures disperse widely. Records in North West, Free State and elsewhere are likely to be immature or vagrant birds.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population in 2002 was estimated at 10 000-25 000 birds (Dodman and Diagana 2006). Taylor et al. (1999) estimated there to be 100-200 mature individuals in the region. A recent survey by van den Hoven and Reily (2012) reported a minimum of 40 mature individuals in the southern portion of Kruger National Park. Extrapolated to the entire park, the population may be in the order of 100 mature individuals. Although regular sightings are reported from sites in northern KwaZulu-Natal as well as along the Limpopo River, the number of birds in the region is unknown. If an estimate of 30 mature individuals is assumed for the Limpopo River and northern KwaZulu-Natal each, the total regional population would be c. 160 mature individuals. The confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global trend is suspected to be decreasing (Dodman and Diagana 2006). Historically, the species has never been abundant and the slow rate of recruitment, coupled with naturally low densities, predisposes the population to local extinction risks (Benn et al. 1995). Based upon the published generation length as well as the estimates provided by Taylor et al. (1999) and the current revised estimate, the reduction over three generations (48 years) would be c. 12%. The population trend would therefore be slightly decreasing although this is dependent upon the accuracy of the population estimates provided. The confidence in this estimate is low due to the unknown generation length.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Saddle-billed Storks occur in aquatic habitats, which include large and small rivers, floodplains, wetlands and pans. Birds are found singly or in pairs and are generally resident with limited nomadic movements in response to feeding opportunities and drought conditions. Resident pairs are territorial and do not tolerate other adult individuals in their home range. The species mainly feeds on fish up to 500 g, which are caught by a stabbing action either in open water or among inundated vegetation. Saddle-billed Storks also feed on amphibians, small reptiles, small mammals, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates. Pairs nests and roost in large trees, often away from water. The generation length of 16.1 years is extrapolated from the mean generation length of Ciconia storks (BirdLife International 2014ao).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The most significant threat to the species is loss of suitable habitat due to a decline in water quality and quantity of the rivers and other waterbodies along which it occurs. This may be a result of water extraction and pollution due to activities such as water provision to urban settlements, agricultural-, industrial- and mining activities and the construction of impoundments within catchments. Similarly, severe drought conditions within the range of the Saddle-billed Stork could also significantly reduce the extent of available habitat. The impact of agricultural chemicals has yet to be determined but could conceivably threaten this species (Monadjem et al. 2003).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The core of the species' range in South Africa falls within Kruger National Park, which is a well-protected conservation area. Current efforts to prevent further degradation of river and wetland habitats within its range should also benefit this species. It is listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No 7 of 2003. The Saddle-billed Stork is listed as Endangered under the South African National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004) and as Endangered in Swaziland and is protected under the Swaziland Game Act of 1991.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Adequate protection of known breeding sites is an important conservation intervention. Implementation of an awareness programme involving all stakeholders and highlighting the threats facing this species is necessary. The potential impact on this species should be considered during the assessment of development applications in catchments.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Although the Yellow-billed Stork Mycteria ibis is a reasonably common sight at wetlands in much of the region, the species currently breeds at only a single site. As such it was assessed as Critically Endangered based on its restricted (breeding) AoO plus extreme fluctuations in numbers of mature individuals. However, it is likely that the regional population receives an immigration of individuals capable of reproducing in the region, and that there is a high likelihood of this immigration continuing; consequently the species was downlisted from regionally Critically Endangered to regionally Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this species occurs within the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">97 cm, 2 kg. Sexes similar in plumage, but males are larger. Wing feathers and tail black. Back, wing coverts, breast and belly white, tinged pink, with reddish tips to some feathers. Bill bright yellow, thicker at base, long and slightly decurved. Bare facial skin orange-red. Legs red. When breeding, the colours of certain features intensify. First-year birds are generally greyish brown with dark brown wings and tails, greyish yellow bills, dull orange faces and greyish legs (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Anderson 2005a). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Yellow-billed Stork occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa and western Madagascar (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It is widespread within the region, but avoids arid western areas and has been described as a faculatively nomadic species (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Some individuals are always present and presumably resident, but the regional population is supplemented by migrants from the north (Anderson 1997a), especially during summer; some immigrants, most of which are probably from the southern Africa, may breed in South Africa. Breeding occurs regularly only at Nsumo Pan in Mkuze Game Reserve (IBA SA057) in KwaZulu-Natal (Bowker and Downs 2012), with historical records from Pongola Nature Reserve in 1985-1986 (Tarboton et al. 1987). There are isolated breeding records from Engelhardt Dam, Kruger National Park (Newman 1980) and Nylsvley (Tarboton 1995). The AoO of a mere 2 km2 is based upon the extent of the breeding range, i.e. Nsumo Pan.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been estimated at 75 000-100 000 mature individuals (Dodman and Diagana 2006). Johnson (2000) estimated a minimum of 300 individuals for the region, with 200 in KwaZulu-Natal, although Anderson (2005b) believed this to be an underestimate. Bowker and Downs (2012) provided data for breeding pairs at Nsumo Pan from 1986-2010 which show large fluctuations in numbers. A minimum of five pairs was recorded in 1989 and a maximum of 163 pairs (370 adults) was observed in 2009. Sixty-four pairs (124 adults) were recorded in 2010. The regional population is estimated to be between 150-350 mature individuals although is subject to large fluctuations. Confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is decreasing, although some populations are stable (Dodman and Diagana 2006). The highly mobile nature and seasonal occurrence make it difficult to detect any population trends and may mask possible declines (Johnson 2000). Based on the Nsumo Pan data (Bowker and Downs 2012), the regional population has increased over the past three generations (25 years). This increase may be partially explained by the loss of the Pongola colony in the early 1980s (Tarboton et al. 1987). In addition, a marked fluctuation in the number of pairs breeding at Nsumo Pan may indicate that there are annual movements of birds from Nsumo Pan to and from sites in neighbouring countries. Alternatively, environmental conditions may limit breeding events. Despite the large fluctuations, the regional population is stable to slightly increasing over a three generation period. Confidence in this trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Yellow-billed Storks forage in a diversity of permanent and seasonal wetland habitats, with open shallow water that is generally free of vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Hancock et al. 2010). Food includes frogs, small fish and other small aquatic prey (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species is usually gregarious, and is often found with other waterbirds (Anderson 1997a). A generation length of 8.4 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014ap).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The main threat to the Yellow-billed Stork is loss of wetland habitats, including the system of pans, marshes and floodplains on which the birds depend for foraging (Monadjem et al. 2003, Anderson 2005a). Loss of suitable trees for the birds to nest in at Pongolapoort Dam resulted in the loss of a breeding colony of around 20 nests in the 1980s (Tarboton et al. 1987).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no species-specific conservation measures underway. Nsumo Pan is situated within the Mkuze section of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. The Park is listed as a provincial nature reserve as well as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Globally, the Yellow-billed Stork is listed on Appendix II of the Bonn Convention. Regionally, it is listed as Near Threatened in Swaziland and is protected under the Swaziland Game Act (1991).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Nesting sites for large, water-associated, colonially nesting birds are crucial for recruitment and maintenance of the population status and conservation of such species; maintenance of the Nsumo Pan site is essential to retain the Yellow-billed Stork as a regionally breeding species. Monitoring of the Nsumo Pan colony, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, needs to be sustained. Re-assessment of historic breeding sites may suggest possibilities for rehabilitation and re-occupation particularly through the establishment of artificial nesting sites at suitable locations.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Antarctic Tern Sterna vittata breeding on the Prince Edward Islands satisfies criterion D for classification as Endangered, with a regional population well below the threshold of less than250 mature individuals. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Antarctic Tern breeds on the Prince Edward Islands and is reproductively isolated from migratory non-breeding birds visiting South African waters. In accordance with the IUCN criteria, the Prince Edward Islands birds are assessed as a separate taxon. This assessment therefore applies only to Antarctic Terns breeding on the Prince Edward Islands and not to birds wintering on small offshore islands or along the coastline of South Africa.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At the subspecific-level, the taxonomy of the Antarctic Tern is in need of revision. Six subspecies are recognised by Gill and Donsker (2015), with the nominate form S. v. vittata being endemic to the western Indian Ocean islands (Crozet and Kerguelen archipelagos and Prince Edward Islands) and this is the most common race visiting South Africa during winter (although three other races also reportedly occur).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">35-40 cm, 140 g. Sexes alike. Crown black. Narrow, white cheek stripe separates grey throat and neck from black cap. Upperparts and wings grey, contrasting with white rump. Tail white to pale grey and forked with long outer rectrices. Underwing with white coverts and secondaries; pale grey primaries with whitish trailing edge. Underparts fairly dark grey, paling slightly on belly. Undertail coverts white. Bill and legs bright red. Eyes dark brown. Non-breeding birds have grizzled crown with white forecrown. Underparts white with outer rectrices shorter than in breeding birds (Tree 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Antarctic Tern breeds on Subantarctic and Southern Ocean islands and on the Antarctic Peninsula (Higgins and Davies 1996) including the Prince Edward Islands. Birds on the Prince Edward Islands breed on the more sheltered eastern coasts (Ryan et al. 2003). Indian Ocean breeding birds, of the nominate race S. v. vittata, are moderately common winter visitors to the coastline and offshore islands of Western and Eastern Cape provinces (Tree and Klages 2004). It is probable, but not known with certainty, that these groups include wintering birds from the Prince Edward Islands. Birds in South African waters occur in loose flocks up to the continental shelf edge, sometimes up to 150 km offshore (Brooke et al. 1988).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014aq). Berruti and Harris (1976) estimated there to be 10-30 pairs on Marion Island. Between 1996/1997 and 2008/2009, the highest estimate at Marion Island was of 10 pairs (Whittington et al 2009). Ryan and Bester (2008) estimated there to be 25 pairs on Marion Island and five pairs on Prince Edward Island. Confidence in this regional population estimate is however low and an urgent investigation is required.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be in decline (BirdLife International 2014aq). From 1974 to 1977, the regional population of Antarctic Terns at Marion Island was less than50 pairs (Williams et al. 1979) decreasing in 1979 to less than20 pairs (Brooke 1984) and then increasing slightly to less than25 pairs in the 1980s (Cooper and Brown 1990). Numbers fluctuated between 1996/1997-2008/2009 from zero to 10 pairs without any apparent trend (Whittington et al. 2009). Four pairs were recorded at the adjacent Prince Edward Island in 2008 (Whittington et al. 2009). Confidence in this regional trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Antarctic Tern is a surface-nesting, summer-breeder (Cooper and Brown 1990) with egg-laying taking place between December and February. A generation length of 11 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014aq). Breeding Antarctic Terns feed almost exclusively at sea (Weimerskirch and Stahl 1988) and time their breeding to coincide with the calmest period of the year (Berruti and Harris 1976). Birds forage over the kelp zone approximately 20-200 m from shore (Berruti and Harris 1976), predominantly by day and sometimes in brightly moonlit conditions (Murphy 1936). Unlike the sympatric Kerguelen Tern S. virgata, Antarctic Terns are not known to forage over land at the Prince Edward Islands (Berruti and Harris 1976), although they do forage over pastures and agricultural lands at Tristan da Cunha (RM Wanless pers. obs).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Subsequent to the removal of cats at Marion Island there are no known, explicit threats to the Antarctic Terns breeding at the Prince Edward Islands. However, the population has failed to recover following eradication of cats, suggesting that other threats are acting on this species. The naturally small population size, particularly at Prince Edward Island, is an intrinsic threat. Because this is apparently a natural situation, mitigating the threat from small population size is not recommended. Because this species migrates northwards for winter (including to South Africa's coastline), it is possible that it experiences threats at wintering sites; this possibility should be investigated.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">None specific to this species but various general conservation and management measures are in place at the Prince Edward Islands.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Until the fundamental aspects of the species' ecology are better understood, no conservation measures are proposed.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Kerguelen Tern Sterna virgata is one of the world's most restricted terns, occurring only on Subantarctic islands in the southern Indian Ocean. It satisfies the criterion for regionally Endangered, according to D (population of less than250 mature individuals). Dedicated surveys, including in coastal areas seldom visited on Marion Island, and summer surveys during peak breeding at Prince Edward Island, may reveal a healthier population. In addition to its small population size, the species satisfies the criterion for regionally Vulnerable under D2 (population with a very restricted AoO, and number of locations (typically less than5), such that it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period in an uncertain future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period).</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Kerguelen Tern breeds on the Prince Edward Islands. In addition, the species was listed as globally Near Threatened in 2015 and regionally Endangered in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Kerguelen Tern is separated into two subspecies, namely S. v. mercuri which occurs at the Crozet Islands, and the nominate S. v. virgata, which inhabits Kerguelen Island (Gomez and Voisin 2002). The two subspecies are separated based upon morphological characters (Gomez and Voisin 2002). The taxonomic status of birds on the Prince Edward islands remains unknown. </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">31 cm. A small, dark tern, with a graceful, buoyant flight reminiscent of a Chlidonias marsh tern. Narrow, white, cheek stripe separates black cap from grey neck. Body grey, with white underwings. Bill dark red. Feet and legs bright red-orange. Separated from Antarctic Tern S. vittata by darker grey colour, finer bill, greyer underwing and shallower tail fork. Non-breeding adult has a grizzled forehead and paler underparts. Bill reddish-black. Immature has a dull red bill, brown cap with heavily barred buff on mantle. Grey wash on underparts is patchy (Gomez and Voisin 2002).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Kerguelen Tern is one of the world's rarest terns, and is restricted to the Crozet, Kerguelen, Marion and Prince Edward island groups in the southern Indian Ocean (Gomez and Voisin 2002). Taking into account the large expanses of sea between the Kerguelen and Crozet islands (1 480 km), and the Crozet and Prince Edward Islands (925 km), as well as the sedentary nature of the species (Weimerskirch and Stahl 1988), exchanges between the Kerguelen Tern populations must be rather restricted (Gomez and Voisin 2002). Ryan and Bester (2008) make mention that it remains at the Prince Edward islands year-round. On Marion Island, birds are found along the west and north coasts between Kampkoppie and Goney Plain (Ryan 1987a). Kerguelen Terns are seldom seen on the east coast of Marion Island (Ryan 1987a). All birds recorded by Ryan (1987a) were seen along the south-eastern side of the island between McNish Bay and the coast opposite Boggel. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been estimated at 3 500-6 500 individuals, roughly equivalent to 2 300-4 300 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014ar). Weimerskirch et al. (1989) placed the Kerguelen Island population of the subspecies S. v. virgata at c. 1 750 mature individuals while Weimerskirch and Stahl (1988) estimated there to be 300-400 mature individuals on Crozet. Ryan (1987a) recorded 45 terns on Prince Edward Island and 11 at Marion Island. Twenty one years later the balance of the populations between the two islands has shifted, with Ryan and Bester (2008) estimating there to be c. 50 pairs on Marion Island and only 5 pairs on Prince Edward Island. Confidence in this regional population estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is believed to be stable (BirdLife International 2014ar). The regional population on Marion Island has fluctuated, averaging 24 pairs over a 12 year period (Whittington et al. 2009). The population on Marion Island decreased from c. 50 pairs in 1974 and 1977 (Williams et al. 1979) to less than10 pairs in 1979 (Brooke 1984), and 5-10 pairs in 1984 (Ryan 1987a). Numbers increased between 1984 and 1996, presumably an effect of reduced predation pressure from introduced cats. Between 1996/1997 and 2008/2009 numbers fluctuated between 12 and 56 pairs, without any apparent trend. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In contrast, the population on Prince Edward Island de&#173;creased from an estimated 25-30 pairs in 1984 (Ryan 1987a) to two pairs in 2001 (Ryan et al. 2003), and to a single pair in 2008 (Whittington et al. 2009). No pairs were observed during the 2011 summer survey at Prince Edward Island (RM Wanless pers. obs.), which was after peak breeding but still suggests the downward trend continued to local extinction; this remains to be confirmed. The increase at Marion Island over the past 20 years is attributed to reduced predation pressure due to the removal of cats (Ryan et al. 2003). Collectively, the regional population on Prince Edward and Marion islands is considered stable, although both populations have undergone marked fluctuations. Confidence in this regional trend estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Kerguelen Tern is a summer-breeding, surface-nesting species (Cooper and Brown 1990). Courtship takes place between August to September (Ryan 1987a), with egg-laying spanning the period from November to January (Whittington et al. 2009). Breeding sites located on Prince Edward Island were on well-vegetated black lava flows, whereas the northern site was on a low grey lava ridge (Ryan 1987a). BirdLife International (2014ar) provides a generation length of 11 years for the Kerguelen Tern. The species is mainly an inshore feeder, with prey consisting of fish and crustaceans (Sagar 1991) although Berruti and Harris (1976) observed individuals feeding over damp Tillaea meadows. The species is also reported to feed over inland crater lakes (Whittington et al. 2009). Most foraging attempts consist of surface dips or picks (86%) with surface attempts comprising the remaining 14%. Studies at the Crozet and Kerguelen island groups demonstrated a catholic diet including fish, crustaceans, molluscs, holothurians, spiders, insects and earthworms (Weimerskirch and Stahl 1988) although Ryan (1987a) recorded only fish being caught at the Prince Edward Islands. </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The breeding populations of both Kerguelen and Antarctic S. vittata terns at île aux Cochons (Crozet Archipelago) were exterminated by feral cats. Terns were not recorded in the diet of cats at Marion Island (van Aarde 1980, van Rensburg 1985) although this may have been due to the small number of terns present in the early 1980s making discovery of their remains in cat diet studies unlikely. Assuming limited exchange between the three island groups, the Kerguelen Tern population at the Prince Edward Islands may be too small to maintain genetic diversity.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no species-specific conservation measures underway. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. A variety of general conservation measures are in place at the Prince Edward Islands.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Establishing the reasons for decreases in the regional population is a high priority. The extreme vulnerability of small populations to random events makes the entire regional population inherently at risk and this species should be accorded the highest conservation priority of all seabirds breeding at the Prince Edward Islands. It should be noted that any activities at Prince Edward Island necessarily involve extreme caution and minimal disturbance, requirements that add unusual constraints to research and conservation work. Other appropriate conservation measures may become apparent once some basic research into the Kerguelen Tern's ecology and population dynamics at Marion Island are better understood. Some initial potential research questions are provided below.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The South African population of Roseate Tern Sterna dougalii breeds at a few small island colonies. Although the population has undergone large fluctuations, there are greater than 250 mature individuals in the region, satisfying the criteria for regionally Endangered under criterion D.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species was assessed as regionally Endangered in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Globally, five subspecies are recognised. South African birds are currently classified with the nominate S. d. dougallii but further research is needed to clarify the complex subspecific taxonomy of this species (Tree 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">33-38 cm, 120 g. Sexes alike. Cap black. Wings, rump and tail pale silver-grey. Outer 3-4 primaries darken with wear. Elongated outer rectrices extend well past wings. Underparts white with pale pink tinge. Bill long and slender with slightly drooping tip; black before breeding, becoming pinkish-red with a black tip during incubation, and returning to black after the young fledge. Non-breeding adults have white foreheads and are less pink below; bill black and legs brownish-orange. Immatures are similar but show a dark bar on the wing coverts. Pink breast develops at one year. Juveniles show heavily mottling and scalloping with black bills and legs that become pinkish during their first year. Easily confused with other tern species (Tree 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Roseate Terns have a large, fragmented global range, breeding in the western and eastern North Atlantic Ocean (North America, Azores, western Europe), from the Arabian Peninsula south to East Africa, Madagascar and South Africa, east to the Indian subcontinent, East Indies and into the western Pacific Ocean and south to Australia (Gochfeld 1983). Within the region, it breeds at Bird and St Croix islands in Algoa Bay and in small numbers at Dyer Island (Crawford et al. 2012a). It has also been recorded breeding at Cape Recife (Randall and Randall 1980, Randall et al. 1991) where large pre- and post-breeding assemblages occur (Tree 2005b). Birds are probably resident within the region with neither North Atlantic nor Indian Ocean birds known to migrate to southern Africa. Roseate Terns are present on their breeding islands from May to October but are present along the coast year-round (Tree 2005b). The species breeds in two IBAs, both of which are protected, namely Algoa Bay Islands: Addo Elephant National Park (IBA SA095) and Dyer Island Nature Reserve (IBA SA120) (Underhill 2000b).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated to be between 70 000 and 82 000 individuals (35 000 to 41 000 pairs; BirdLife International 2014as). In 2010, 300 pairs were recorded in the region, but this number dropped to 100 pairs in 2011 (Crawford et al. 2012a). The population is known to fluctuate but is thought be less than250 mature individuals. Confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, while others are increasing or stable (Wetlands International 2006). Numbers of Roseate Terns breeding in South Africa have been low since population counts began in 1967. Breeding was recorded at Cape Recife in 1967 (39 pairs) and 1968 (71 pairs) but only roosting birds have been recorded since then. Low numbers of breeding pairs have been recorded at Dyer Island since 1971, ranging from no breeding to 20 pairs, with no clear upward or downward trend. At St Croix Island, 118-139 breeding pairs were recorded in 1977. Until 2003, counts have been erratic, and in some years only the presence of breeding birds has been recorded. In 2003, there were 30 breeding pairs at St Croix Island, which then increased to 58 in 2007 followed by a decrease to 25 in 2008 (Crawford et al. 2012a). No Roseate Terns have been recorded breeding at this island from 2009. The species was first recorded breeding at Bird Island in 1977 and the first count (130 pairs) occurred in 1986. This colony reached a peak of between 240 and 250 breeding pairs from 1999 to 2001 and fluctuated in numbers from 2003 to 2010. The population is prone to a considerable amount of fluctuation although over a three generation period, the population trend is stable. Confidence in this regional trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Roseate Terns breed on sand dunes, sand spits and rocky beaches (Randall et al. 1991). A generation length of 10.2 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014as). Low rocky headlands, and less often beaches and sandbanks, are preferred as roosting sites (Tree 2005b). Roseate Terns feed on small pelagic fish caught by plunge diving; fishing mostly occurs within 2 km of the colony, often in association with other seabirds (Randall et al. 1991). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Breeding Roseate Terns are vulnerable to disturbance as they do not return to their nests immediately when displaced (Underhill 2000b), thus leaving eggs and chicks vulnerable to predation by Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus. Chicks are vulnerable to hypothermia during cold, wet weather (Randall et al. 1991). In West Africa, decreases have been attributed to hunting (BirdLife International 2014as).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No specific-specific conservation measures are currently underway in South Africa. Breeding sites on Bird and Dyer islands are protected as nature reserves. A control programme aimed at controlling number of the predatory Kelp Gull is ongoing at Bird Island, which is likely to benefit this species as well as other seabirds. Globally, efforts are underway to improve breeding habitat by constructing artificial nesting sites and nest boxes, vegetation management and flood control (BirdLife International 2014as). The species is protected in terms of South Africa's Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, No. 46 of 1973.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Disturbance at both breeding and roosting sites should be limited. A full study of what conservation measures will be most beneficial to Roseate Terns should also be conducted.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The elusive, forest-dwelling Spotted Ground Thrush Zoothera guttata has an estimated AoO of 260 km2 and is believed to be experiencing a continuing decline in (i) extent of occurrence, (ii) area of occupancy, (iii) area, extent and/or quality of habitat; and (v) number of mature individuals. The species is consequently assessed as regionally Endangered. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population is the largest of the several fragmented populations found throughout Africa. The species was assessed as regionally Endangered in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Endangered.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are five races of Spotted Ground Thrush in Africa, of which the nominate G. g. guttata occurs in South Africa. Harebottle et al. (1997) found no morphological reasons for splitting South African taxa from the other four races. The species is sometimes placed in the genus Geokichla.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">22-23 cm, 68 g. Sexes are alike in terms of plumage colouration, but males are slightly larger. Upperparts, including crown and scapulars, are rusty olive-brown. Moustachial area, lores and ear coverts white. Malar stripe black. Upperwings mostly brown. Underparts white, breast and flanks often tinged buff, with large, bold, black drop-shaped spots. Two distinctive white bars adorn the wing coverts. Eye dark brown. Bill black to grey-black; base of lower mandible whitish, pale yellow or pinkish. Legs and feet pale pink. Juvenile similar but upperparts mottled with buff (Chittenden 2005c). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Spotted Ground-Thrush has a widespread but fragmented distribution in Africa, occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, South Sudan and Tanzania (Ndang'ang'a et al. 2005). Within the region, breeding populations occur in mature coastal forests in Eastern Cape (including Mkambati Nature Reserve, Cwebe Nature Reserve, Dwesa Forest, Egossa Forest, Ntsubane Forest, Mtambalala Forest, Mpame Forest and Manubi Forest), and in Coastal Scarp and Valley forests in southern KwaZulu-Natal (Oribi Gorge) and northern KwaZulu-Natal (Ngoye Forest, Entumeni Forest and Dhlinza Forest (Berruti 1997c, Harebottle and Barnes 2000). The South African population does not extend into southern Mozambique, and is essentially isolated from populations further north in Africa. The current southernmost limit of the regional population is around the Kei River in Eastern Cape; beyond this, forests are generally considered unsuitable to support significant populations of this species (Harebottle and Barnes 2000). Nevertheless, the Southern Ground Thrush was historically recorded as far south as Alexandria and Patensie near Port Elizabeth (Benson 1950). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Non-breeding birds undertake localised movements in winter, moving to scattered fragments of forests all along the coast from Lake St Lucia to Cove Rock (Harebottle 1994, Harebottle and Barnes 2000). A comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 data suggests that the species has undergone a reduction in range (in terms of EoO and AoO) since SABAP1. Ngoye Forest (70-100 pairs), Dhlinza Forest (20-25 pairs) and Entumeni Nature Reserve (20-30 pairs) are the most important sites for the conservation of the species and are listed as IBAs.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been estimated at 600-1 700 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014at). Harebottle and Barnes (2000) estimated that 800-1 600 mature individuals occur within the region, although forest degradation and alteration has undoubtedly led to reduced habitat availability and a consequent decline in population size. The regional population is estimated to be less than600 mature individuals. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be declining due to habitat loss and degradation occurring throughout its range (BirdLife International 2014at). Surveys of Kenyan coastal forest in 2003 suggest that the species may have undergone very rapid declines since the 1980s (Ndang'ang'a et al. 2005). The regional population is believed to be decreasing due to destruction and fragmentation of habitat in KwaZulu-Natal. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Found mostly in dappled, open areas in forest understorey, tending to avoid both dense thickets and open areas (Harebottle 1994). The species undertakes two different migration patterns: Eastern Cape breeders migrate to KwaZulu-Natal coastal forests in March-May and return in August-September; populations breeding in northern KwaZulu-Natal undertake a partial altitudinal migration eastwards to coastal forests in March-May and return in August (Harebottle 1994, Chittenden 2005c). This is apparently in response to prey abundance (Harebottle 1994). Density in Dhlinza Forest, a breeding locality in northern KwaZulu-Natal, ranges from 3.4-4.1 birds/ha (Ndang'ang'a et al. 2005). A generation length of three years is provided by BirdLife International (2014at). The diet consists mostly of earthworms, as well as other invertebrates including snails. Birds forage singly or in pairs in leaf litter on the forest floor. In the breeding season, Spotted Ground Thrushes defend a feeding territory of c. 0.5-1 ha against conspecifics, but may forage alongside other terrestrial forest insectivores (Chittenden 2005c).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Although breeding sites are mostly conserved, continued deforestation of fragments of Coastal Dune, Scarp and Coastal Lowland forests in KwaZulu-Natal (wintering grounds) is a threat. In KwaZulu-Natal, 22 provincial nature and forest reserves have suitable habitat, but funding through Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife for the protection of these sites is being reduced, threatening the viability of the sites. Planned coastal dune mining, south of Richards Bay, may have a negative impact on annual altitudinal migration of the northern KwaZulu-Natal population. Some casualties occur from collisions with buildings during migration. Predation, particularly of nests, by domestic cats Felis catus and Vervet Monkeys Chlorocebus pygerythrus is a factor of growing concern (Chittenden 2005c). Climate change and range-change predictions suggest further range decreases, and concomitant population declines (BirdLife International and Durham University 2012).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no current active conservation actions in place for this species within the region. In 2005, under the auspices of the African Species Working Group, an International Spotted Ground Thrush Interest Group was formed, coordinated by an International Species Action Plan Coordinator and, at national level, by National Species Action Plan Coordinators. Unfortunately, very little implementation of its recommendations appears to have occurred to date. Globally, the species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Regionally, the species is protected under the Environmental Conservation Act (Act No. 73 of 1989), as well as the Kwa&#173;&#173;Zulu-Natal Conservation Management Amendment Act (Act No. 5 of 1999).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) is recommended, as is a Biodiversity Management Plan, culminating in a National Species Recovery Plan. Ongoing monitoring of Spotted Ground Thrush populations at breeding sites needs to be undertaken. Improved conservation status of breeding, non-breeding and stop-over sites must be secured throughout its range. Legislative issues may need to be reviewed in Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Awareness and publicity for conservation of the Spotted Ground Thrush among stakeholders should be raised.</p>

</div>
<div id="_idContainer609" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres is classified as Endangered, having satisfied criterion A2: an observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population size reduction of =50% over the last 48 years (three-generation period) where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased and may not be reversible.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The majority of this vulture's range falls within the region. In addition, it was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in the 2000 Regional Red List assessment and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable by BirdLife International (2014au).</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Cape Vulture has in the past been considered a subspecies of the Griffon Vulture G. fulvus (Mundy et al. 1992) but recent genetic analysis suggests its closest affinities may lie with the Indian Vulture G. indicus and Slender-billed Vulture G. tenuirostris of Asia (Arshad et al. 2009). The species is monotypic. The Cape Vulture is part of a superspecies, the other members of which are the Griffon, Indian, Slender-billed, Rüppell's G. rueppellii and Himalayan G. himalayensis vultures (Snow 1978).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">1.0-1.2 m, 7.3-10.9 kg. Sexes alike in appearance, but female slightly larger. Head and neck bluish, bordered by ruff of fluffy white feathers. Crop patch with dark brown feathers and twin, bare blue patches on breast. Body feathers off-white, creamy or russet. Scapulars and tertials brown, edged white. Tail blackish brown. Remiges dark; undersides of secondaries paler and tipped black. Upperwing coverts whitish; greater coverts with large central black patch. Underwing coverts whitish; sometimes with row of sub-terminal black spots on greater underwing coverts. Bill and cere black. Eye straw-yellow. Legs and feet black. Immatures gradually transition to adult plumage over about six years. Juveniles are darker, with woolly down on head, and bare pinkish skin on hindneck, and red patches on breast, and streaked underparts; eyes initially black, becoming yellow in fifth or sixth year.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Readily confused with White-backed Vulture G. africanus, especially when seen in flight and over distance. Adult Cape Vultures are differentiated from White-backed Vultures by their larger size, straw-coloured eyes, and blue colour to the exposed skin on the head, neck and breast patches. Seen in flight from below, the adult has pale, silvery secondaries that contrast poorly with the equally pale underwing coverts. Adults (and older immatures) often show a line of distinct dark spots along the greater upperwing coverts, and along both the greater underwing coverts and greater under primary coverts, in both cases most conspicuous when seen in flight from above and below. The more streaked juvenile and immature Cape Vultures differ primarily from young White-backed Vultures in the reddish colour to the exposed skin of the head, neck and breast patches, which are black in all age classes of the latter species. They are also never as dark and heavily streaked as juvenile White-backed Vultures. In flight, young Cape Vultures lack the striking pale lines typically present in the underwing coverts of young White-backed Vultures (Mundy et al. 1992, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Cape Vulture has one of the most limited distributions of any Old World vulture species, being restricted to southern Africa and predominantly South Africa and Lesotho (Mundy et al. 1992). The regional population is divided into three primary ‘nodes', one each in the north-east (Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West and Gauteng provinces), south-east (mainly in Lesotho and the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces, extending marginally into adjacent parts of Free State Province and Swaziland) and south-west (Western Cape Province) of the region. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In the north-eastern node, there are breeding colonies in Limpopo, North West and Gauteng provinces (Benson et al. 1990, Benson 2004, Whittington-Jones et al. 2011), which are characteristically relatively few in number but are large in size, i.e. up to 1 000 pairs (Benson et al. 1990, Mundy et al. 1992). The species apparently no longer breeds in Mpumalanga Province (Herholdt et al. 1997). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Relevant to the south-eastern node, in Lesotho the species now breeds only in the highlands (Jilbert 1983, Donnay 1990, Maphisa 1997). In KwaZulu-Natal, breeding occurs mainly along the Drakensberg Escarpment and adjacent parts of the ‘Little Berg', although breeding is now largely restricted to the northern parts of this region (Brown and Piper 1988). Away from this area, the only remaining breeding localities in KwaZulu-Natal are a colony at Oribi Flats near Port Shepstone (Piper and Neethling 2002) and a site in the Greytown District that may only support a single remnant pair (SC Krüger, Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, unpubl. data). In Eastern Cape Province, the breeding range of the Cape Vulture has contracted to the eastern half of the province, largely within or adjacent to the former Transkei region (Boshoff and Vernon 1980, Boshoff et al. 2009). In contrast to the position in the north-eastern node, the breeding colonies in the south-eastern node are characteristically relatively many in number but are small in size, i.e. typically far fewer than 200 pairs (Mundy et al. 1992). The species no longer breeds in Free State Province and the single possible remnant colony mentioned by Colahan (2004) as present in 1983 is no longer active (DG Allan unpubl. data). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The south-western node in Western Cape Province now encompasses only a single, fairly small and highly isolated breeding colony: Potberg , which supported 69 pairs in 2012 (Boshoff and Vernon 1980, Shaw 2004).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Outside the region, the species also occurs in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia, and is a vagrant to Angola and Zambia (Mundy et al. 1997, Parker 1999, Bamford et al. 2007). Outside the region, it only breeds in Botswana (Borello and Borello 2002) and Mozambique, although the most recent published account of breeding at the single (and small) colony in the latter country dates to July 2002, when six incubating adults were observed (Monadjem 2003). The Cape Vulture is now extinct as a breeding species in Namibia (Simmons 2002) and does not currently breed at the single locality where they have bred in the past in Zimbabwe (Mundy 1997b, Mundy et al. 1997).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The most comprehensive estimate of the Cape Vulture's population size is that contained in the unpublished PhD thesis of Piper (1994) who estimated the global population at about 12 000 birds and 4 400 breeding pairs (i.e. 8 800 mature individuals). Of these, about 11 000 birds and 4 050 pairs (8 100 mature individuals) were claimed for the region (South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland). Piper (2004a, 2004b, 2005a), however, presented revised global population estimates, for the years 2000 (in the first instance) and 2003 (in the second and third instances), of 8 000, 10 000 and 8 000 birds, and 3 000+ (in the first two instances) and 3 000 breeding pairs, respectively, but without presenting supporting details. Piper (2004a) suggested that the breeding population had decreased by about 15% between 1980 and 2000, i.e. -0.79% per year, but again without providing supporting details. A 2013 update of the global estimate of the current number of breeding pairs provides very similar, but marginally larger, numbers to those of Piper: 4 700 pairs (9 400 mature individuals) of which 4 400 pairs (8 800 mature individuals) occur in the region (BirdLife South Africa in prep.). The north-eastern node supports c. 56% of the regional breeding pairs, the south-eastern node 42% and the south-western node 2%. The regional population is estimated at 8 800 mature individuals. Confidence in this population estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Comprehensive, regular, long-term monitoring of the total number of breeding pairs (i.e. mature individuals) at each and every Cape Vulture breeding colony in the region has not been achieved so far and would be logistically challenging. Therefore the most feasible way to estimate the trend in Cape Vulture numbers would be to examine information from the relatively few breeding colonies monitored on a regular basis over an adequate time period (i.e. over three generations or 48 years; see below). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Unfortunately, only three Cape Vulture colonies have accurate count information extending this far back in time, i.e. to about the mid-1960's, and all three are small to medium-sized colonies. Potberg (Western Cape) supported 32 pairs in 1965 and 69 in 2012, Aasvoelberg (near Zastron, Free State) had 41 pairs in 1965 but is now extinct as a breeding site, and Wilge River (Mpumalanga) had 12 pairs in 1962 but breeding also no longer occurs there (BirdLife South Africa in prep.). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A much larger sample of breeding colonies, 32 in total, was known in the 1960s, but accurate count information from this early time period is not available for these (BirdLife South Africa in prep.). The provinces in which these additional sites are located are as follows (from north to south): Limpopo - 2 (extant), Mpumalanga - 1 (extinct), North West - 2 (one extant), Gauteng - 1 (extant), Free State - 2 (extinct), KwaZulu-Natal - 1 (extinct) and Eastern Cape - 23 (seven extant). Of these 32 localities, only 11 still support breeding pairs today. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Taken together, this information from the total of 35 Cape Vulture breeding colonies known in the 1960's, suggests a 66% decrease in the number of colonies between that time period and currently, i.e. over three generations, and may infer a similar reduction in the total number of mature individuals. It should also be noted that Colahan and Esterhuizen (1997) document at least 32 breeding colonies as present in the Free State ‘around 1960', all now extinct. If this information is integrated with that above, the total regional number of known colonies in the 1960's rises to 64 of which 12 are extant (none in the Free State), i.e. an 81% reduction in colonies, and, by inference, the total number of mature individuals. This estimate is heavily biased towards colonies in Free State, where the species has undergone a particularly severe decrease and likely not representative of the entire regional range as a whole. However in the absence of suitable baseline data, it is suspected from the available data that the decrease in the regional population has been greater than 50% over a 48 year period. Confidence in this regional population trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The breeding biology of the Cape Vulture is fairly well known (Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005e, Tarboton 2011). The age of first breeding is six years, rarely 4-5 years with an estimated 80-93% of pairs breeding annually (see Benson (1997) for confirmation that some marked adults do not breed annually). Cape Vultures nest on tall cliff faces, typically in fairly large and discrete colonies numbering up to 1 000 pairs (Benson et al. 1990). The species is monogamous. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Egg-laying spans March-September, mainly April-July, with a May-June peak with the timing of breeding appearing to synchronise the period of highest food demand (the middle third of the nestling period) with the period of highest food availability (Komen and Brown 1993). The clutch almost invariably comprises a single egg, only very rarely are two eggs recorded (less than1% of instances and possibly involving two females). The combined incubation and nestling periods cover some 6-7 months and an entire successful breeding attempt from nest building to the final independence of the fledgling can take up to almost a full calendar year. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Breeding success (fledglings or large nestlings produced per egg laid) is 45-78% (mean=60%) (Mundy et al. 1992); at Kransberg breeding success (fledglings produced per occupied site) spanned 37-61% (mean 50%) per year (Benson 2000). The generation time of the species is unknown but has been estimated at 16 years (BirdLife International 2014au).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Cape Vulture seems to have foraged, at least ancestrally, across all of the characteristically more open vegetation types, i.e. Fynbos, Karoo, Kalahari, grassland and open woodland (Mundy 1983, Mundy et al. 1992, Mundy et al. 1997). It is essentially excluded from forest and dense woodland likely due to difficulties in locating and accessing suitable carcasses in such habitat (Schultz 2007). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Gyps vultures are unique among extant vertebrates in being obligate scavengers (Ruxton and Houston 2004, Dermody et al. 2011, Ogada et al. 2012). They feed, typically in large groups, on large mammalian carcasses, both wild and domestic, favouring the soft internal organs and muscle tissue (Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005e). These vultures typically search for food communally, fanning out to search for carcasses on the wing and responding to cues from one another (Houston 1974). Recent research has emphasised the important ecological role played by these birds in carcass removal, e.g. related to disease control (Ogada et al. 2012). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threats to the Cape Vulture are from contamination (and perhaps shortage) of their food supply, negative interactions with human infrastructure and their demand for use in the traditional health industry. Threats reducing adult survival, as is the case relevant to many of the dangers discussed below, are of particular concern, as the population stability of this species, which evidences a naturally low reproductive rate, likely depends on high adult survival rates.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Poisoning as a major threat to the Cape Vulture has been recognised for decades (Boshoff and Vernon 1980, Benson 2000, Verdoorn 2004). Documented instances and discussion of the problem in the literature is legion as is the list of poisons used and, despite exhaustive efforts to publicise and counteract this, Cape Vultures continue to be poisoned in large numbers and on a regular basis (McKean 2004). The wide-ranging and communal foraging behaviour of Cape Vultures means that a tiny minority of humans employing poisons, operating at only a local scale, have the potential to significantly impact a large proportion of the regional vulture population (Boshoff and Vernon 1980).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Poisoning appears mainly incidental and a byproduct of targeting mammalian predators. The use of most of these poisons is illegal, as is the lacing of large carcasses with any poison. Some of these poisons have now been outlawed and removed from the marketplace but extensive stockpiles likely exist in some quarters (Boshoff and Currie 1981, Scott 1994, Wysoke et al. 1994, Scott 1997a, Verdoorn 1997b, Scott 1997c, Shaw 2004, Naidoo et al. 2011). Sub-lethal doses of poisoning can cause mortality through birds perched on cliffs suffering seizures and falling from the ledges (Benson 2000). Nestlings are known to have been poisoned by their parents feeding them poisoned meat (Benson 2000). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Poisoning can also be intentional and targeted specifically at vultures if the birds are perceived as a threat to livestock, purveyors of disease and plagues, or related to some nuisance factor (Boshoff and Vernon 1979, 1980, Mundy 1983, Boshoff 1989, Pringle 1990, Mundy et al. 1992, Snyman and Snyman 1997, Scott 1997a, Anderson 2000f). Lead poisoning through ingesting lead bullets and bullet fragments in carcasses is a further potential threat (Boshoff et al. 2009) and one that has been confirmed in other vulture species (Adaudi et al. 1990, Mateo et al. 1997, Platt et al. 1999, Miller et al. 2000, Clark and Scheuhammer 2003, Mateo et al. 2003, Garcia-Fernandez et al. 2005, Pattee et al. 2006).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Electrocution by electrical infrastructure is another major source of mortality and this threat dates back to at least 1948 (Markus 1972, Ledger and Annegarn 1981, van Rooyen 2000, Kruger et al. 2004).&#9;An additional major threat emanating from electrical infrastructure is collisions with overhead lines by flying vultures (Naidoo et al. 2011). Collisions with other types of overhead lines are another problem (Benson and Dobbs 1984, Benson 2000, 2004). Cape Vultures also sporadically collide with fences, including at supplementary feeding sites (Benson and Dobbs 1984; Piper 2004a). Alongside nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIs), wind farms rank prominently among potentially major threats to the Cape Vulture (Rushworth and Krüger 2013). The harvesting of vultures for the traditional medicine is a widespread practice and could materially contribute to hastening extinction (Mundy 1983, Beilis and Esterhuizen 2006, Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Food shortage is widely cited as a major threat (Boshoff and Vernon 1980, Benson 1997, Maphisa 1997, Benson 2000, Benson et al. 2004) but direct evidence on this point is sparse. Past decreases in the numbers of Cape Vultures have also been related to the eradication of the ancestral game herds in the region (Boshoff and Vernon 1980). It has been demonstrated that dense tree cover can retard the location and access of carcasses by Cape Vultures and that bush encroachment therefore could potentially pose an indirect threat to the species (Schultz 2007, Bamford et al. 2009b).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Another cause of mortality in Cape Vultures is drowning in circular, concrete farm reservoirs, particularly in the drier western parts of the region (Anderson et al. 1999). Disturbance of Cape Vultures at their cliff nesting colonies can potentially result in lower breeding success and even complete desertion of such sites (Benson and Dobbs 1985, Verdoorn 1992, Borello and Borello 2002). Aircraft flying in close proximity to colonies; including micro-light aircraft and hang-gliders, constitutes another potential source of disturbance (Robertson 1989, Verdoorn 1997a, Scott 1997b) but the significance of this requires confirmation.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Fires at breeding colonies may (Ledger and Mundy 1975) or may not (Verdoorn and Becker 1992, Scott 1997b) present a danger to breeding birds but is likely to be a fairly minor threat as these rarely (if ever) reach actual nest sites. Anthropogenically driven climate change, essentially increased ambient temperatures, has been proposed as a potential threat to the Cape Vulture (Simmons and Jenkins 2007). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Vulture Study Group, established in 1977 and with an African, and mainly southern Africa, focus, was largely formed on the basis of concern for the survival of the Cape Vulture (Mundy et al. 1992). This group is now essentially subsumed into the broader Bird of Prey Programme of the Endangered Wildlife Trust with the work on this species synchronised by a Cape Vulture Task Force formed in 2006. VulPro is involved directly in several vulture conservation initiatives, with the Cape Vulture as the organisation's primary focal species. Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, the provincial nature conservation authority in that province, initiated a Cliff-nesting Vulture Survey project in 2000. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A recently established global organisation is the IUCN Vulture Specialist Group formed in 2011. Vulture News, a journal dedicated to publishing information on vulture research and conservation efforts and which was initiated in 1979 by the Vulture Study Group, is now the journal of the IUCN Vulture Specialist Group. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife initiated annual Vulture Count Days on International Vulture Awareness Day from 2003. A workshop in 2006 resulted in a formal conservation plan for the Cape Vulture (Boshoff and Anderson 2006) with goal of stabilising the Cape Vulture population. Reviews to this plan were made in 2010 and 2012. Conservation plans for the species have also been produced for the Western Cape Province, essentially covering the Potberg colony (Boshoff and Robertson 1985; Scott 1997c). A vulture conservation strategy for KwaZulu-Natal covering the 5-year period 2008-2012 and including the Cape Vulture has been produced (Rushworth 2008). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A ‘Poison Working Group' of the Endangered Wildlife Trust, established in 1991 and subsequently subsumed into a Wildlife Conflict Prevention Programme, worked to combat poisoning in the Cape Vulture (Verdoorn 1997b). Unfortunately this group became defunct in 2012 due to funding shortages. The Wildlife and Energy Programme of the Endangered Wildlife Trust is targeted at minimising the risk to wildlife posed by energy and communications infrastructure, including the dangers to large birds such as the Cape Vulture stemming from electrocution by, and collisions with, such infrastructure (van Rooyen and Piper 1997, Jenkins et al. 2010). Both BirdLife South Africa and the Endangered Wildlife Trust are active in bird conservation issues related to the fledgling wind-energy industry in the region, largely co-ordinated through a Bird and Wind Energy Specialist Group which the two organisations co-chair. The rescue, rehabilitation and release by recognised rehabilitation facilities of vultures temporarily incapacitated by the various threats faced by the species is an increasingly important conservation measure (Snyman and Snyman 1997, Verdoorn et al. 1997, Verrynne 1997, Naidoo et al. 2011, Monadjem et al. 2013). Key facilities recently involved in such rehabilitation work include VulPro (North West Province), De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Trust (Gauteng), National Zoological Gardens of South Africa (Gauteng) and the African Bird of Prey Sanctuary (KwaZulu-Natal).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Similar to the position relevant to research questions, the proceedings of the vulture research and conservation workshop held in 1997 (Boshoff et al. 1997) also identify a wide range of direct conservation actions and priorities pertaining to vultures, including the Cape Vulture, many of which remain equally relevant. These include addressing the threats stemming from poisoning, energy-related infrastructure, the traditional health industry, food shortages, drowning, disturbance, and negative perceptions and ignorance. The proceedings also call for intensified monitoring of Cape Vulture breeding colonies and roosts. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The proceedings from a follow-up workshop in 2004 (Monadjem et al. 2004) contain a concluding paper (Boshoff 2004) reviewing progress on conservation research and action since the 1997 workshop. This paper, as well as Boshoff and Anderson (2006) laments the lack of overarching and strategic planning, and the absence of priority setting, relevant to vulture conservation and research initiatives, including those applying to the Cape Vulture. The ‘Site Register', initiated by the Vulture Study Group, is currently curated by the Birds of Prey Programme and this information, especially that related to breeding sites, should be integrated with other similar unpublished and published data, and be published as a comprehensive monograph as a matter of high priority.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The scourge of poisoning needs to be combatted by the rigorous investigation and prosecution of all such instances, as well as the maintenance of ongoing and high-profile education and publicity campaigns emphasising the causes and consequences of such incidents. The legal penalties need to be severe enough to act as material deterrents. A move to lead-free ammunition should be considered where relevant. Careful monitoring of the potential use of diclofenac, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIs) lethal to Gyps vultures, is required. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Additional effort is required to reduce electrocutions and collisions of Cape Vultures with power-line infrastructure (Boshoff and Michael 2009, Boshoff et al. 2011b). Existing pylons and overhead lines need to be replaced or retro-fitted, on a carefully prioritised basis, and new infrastructure needs to designed and routed, to minimise the risks from electrocution and collisions. Particular care will be required in the immediate future, as wind farms spread across the region's landscapes, to ensure that this industry does not pose a significant threat to the Cape Vulture. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Relevant to the trade in Cape Vulture body parts in the traditional health industry, Mander et al. (2007) call for an intervention strategy to be developed that addresses the following primary areas of action: a) reduce consumption/demand for vultures through an awareness-building campaign targeting public consumers and current roleplayers in the trade; b) change/create policy to improve regulation of the vulture trade; c) improve policing and enforcement for better regulation of the vulture trade; d) improve understanding of the vulture trade to allow more focused interventions, including research and monitoring of the use and trade of vultures. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Firm steps must be maintained to confirm that the food provided at ‘vulture restaurants' is free from toxins harmful to the birds. Similar ongoing action is required to control the dangers from human disturbance at colonies. Finally, the compilation of a Biodiversity Management Plan covering the species, as envisioned by the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004 (Act No. 10 of 2004), is an urgent priority (Webster 2012). </p>

	<p class="Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Lappet-faced Vulture</p>
	<p class="Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Torgos tracheliotos</p>
</div>

<div id="_idContainer622" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Lappet-faced Vulture Torgos tracheliotos is expected to undergo a population size reduction of greater than 50% within the next three generations (45 years), based on potential levels of exploitation. A recent escalation of large-scale poisoning incidents in the southern African range of the species, motivated by the masking of poaching operations and harvesting for the traditional health industry, is of high concern. In addition the species qualifies as regionally Endangered due to the small regional population (less than2 500 mature individuals), with at least 95% of mature individuals belonging to a single sub-population. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The formally threatened status of the Lappet-faced Vulture dates to the second South African Red Data Book which categorised it as Vulnerable (Brooke 1984), a ranking it retained in the 2000 assessment (Barnes 2000a). It is categorised as globally Vulnerable (BirdLife International 2014av). </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">It has been suggested that the genus Torgos should be merged with Aegypius (White 1951, Amadon 1977, Stresemann and Amadon 1979, Amadon et al. 1988); this is ostensibly supported by molecular genetic analyses (Wink and Sauer-Gürth 2000, 2004). Three subspecies are proposed: the nominate tracheliotos which is widespread from West to southern Africa; nubicus of north-east Africa; and negevensis of the Middle East. The specific name tracheliotos is frequently misspelled as ‘tracheliotus' (Mundy et al. 1992). </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">98-105 cm, 4.4-8.5 kg. Sexes alike. The Lappet-faced Vulture is characterised by its massive size, large bare head with pink and blue skin with prominent skin folds and lappets, plus robust bill, especially compared with the superficially similar Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus. The adult shows white leggings and white lines through the middle of the underwing coverts, but is otherwise dark. Bill yellowish with blue base and cere. Eye dark. Legs and feet pale blue-grey. Juveniles transition to adult plumage over about six years, and differ from adults mainly in their brown ‘leggings' and darker bills. Young birds also lack white wing markings and thus appear very similar to juvenile and immature Hooded Vultures and White-headed Vultures Aegypius occipitalis (Mundy et al. 1992, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lappet-faced Vulture occurs in the northern regions of South Africa and in eastern Swaziland (Mundy 1997e). The current range is much reduced from earlier times (Boshoff et al. 1983, Tarboton and Allan 1984, Mundy 1997e, Monadjem 2003, Monadjem et al. 2003), and it has disappeared as a breeding species from Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape south of the Orange River (Boshoff et al. 1983, Anderson and Maritz 1997). The species bred in the Free State in historical times but is now only an occasional non-breeding visitor there (Colahan and Esterhuizen 1997, Colahan 2004), as it is in Gauteng (Whittington-Jones 2004), although it likely bred there ancestrally. There is no evidence that it ever bred in Lesotho (Bonde 1993). The overall distribution in the region, however, appears similar between the two atlas projects. As with the White-backed Vulture Gyps africanus, however, SABAP2 shows records from further west in KwaZulu-Natal than did SABAP1. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 5 700 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014av). In the region covered by the former Transvaal, the Lappet-faced Vulture appeared to be restricted as a breeding species to the eastern Lowveld conservation areas, mainly in the Kruger National Park, where the population was estimated as unlikely to exceed 40 pairs in the late 1970s (Tarboton and Allan 1984). One additional breeding pair, however, was known from the Limpopo Valley in the north-west of that erstwhile province (Tarboton and Allan 1984). During annual surveys covering the period 1982-1993 up to 49 active nests (in 1990) were recorded, and up to 100 pairs estimated, in Kruger National Park, with a concentration in the northern third of the park (Herholdt et al. 1997). A recent (2011) estimate for Kruger National Park is 78 (95% CI ±18) pairs, with an indication, contra to Herholdt et al. (1997), of a concentration in the southern third of the reserve.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">After the mid-1990s, breeding was recorded in the Pilanesberg National Park and Lichtenberg and Madikwe nature reserves (Verdoorn et al. 1997, Verdoorn 2004). All three of these protected areas occur in the region formerly covered by the Transvaal, although they now lie in North West province. Breeding has also been recorded further west from Molopo Nature Reserve in North West (Verdoorn 2004). The species seemed to increase in North West Province in the 15 years prior to 2004 (Verdoorn et al. 1997, Verdoorn 2004). There are also regular reports of adult and immature Lappet-faced vultures seen in the Magaliesberg (K Wolter pers. comm) which covers both Gauteng and North West provinces.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In Northern Cape, the population in the late 1990s was estimated at maximum 45 pairs, with 33 pairs known, including at least two pairs (and possibly up to eight) in the South African portion of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, 30 pairs in the Kalahari outside the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and one pair at Rooipoort near Kimberley (Anderson and Maritz 1997). Indeed, Anderson and Maritz (1997) suggested that the number of breeding pairs in Northern Cape may have increased in recent times due to improved land-owner attitudes. In the mid-2000s, this increase was considered ongoing; the estimated total population was revised upwards to possibly as high as 50 pairs (Anderson 2004).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In KwaZulu-Natal, 15 breeding pairs occurred in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HIP) in 1972 and 1973 (Hitchins 1980). This number had apparently remained constant since 1970 and 12 of these breeding pairs have been known since 1961. A total of 14 pairs were present in 1989 (Howells et al. 2011) A single pair of breeding Lappet-faced Vultures established in Ithala Game Reserve in 2005 (Rushworth et al. 2007). The total, the KwaZulu-Natal population was estimated at 25 pairs in the mid-1990s (Piper and Johnson 1997) and up to 20 pairs (all in protected areas) in 2004 (Rushworth and Piper 2004). The population was believed to be decreasing in the mid-2000s (Rushworth and Piper 2004). In 2007, the KwaZulu-Natal population was estimated at nine pairs, six in HIP, one in Mkuze Game Reserve, one in Pongolo Nature Reserve and one in Ithala (McKean et al. 2013). In 2011, 12 pairs were counted in HIP, two pairs in Mkuze Game Reserve, two pairs in Pongolo Nature Reserve and one pair in Pongola Private Game Reserve (Howells et al. 2011).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Swaziland breeding population was estimated at three breeding pairs in the mid-1990s (Parker 1997). This situation remained unchanged in 2002 with the only three Swaziland breeding pairs occurring in the Hlane-Mlawula reserve complex (Monadjem et al. 2003, Monadjem 2004a, Monadjem and Garcelon 2005).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Uneven coverage and the outdated nature of some estimates make an accurate current estimate of the total breeding population for the region uncertain. The best estimate would be a maximum of about 169 breeding pairs (i.e. 338 mature individuals), with 78 pairs in Kruger National Park, 50 in Northern Cape, 18 in KwaZulu-Natal, and three in Swaziland, in addition to a maximum of perhaps a further 20 pairs outside these areas, i.e. Lowveld conservation areas adjacent to Kruger National Park, Limpopo Valley and North West. This is similar to the 150-200 pairs estimated by Anderson (2000g). Confidence in the regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be declining at a moderately rapid rate, based on anecdotal information on regional declines, and extirpation in some parts of its range (BirdLife International 2014av). As documented above, the Lappet-faced Vulture has disappeared entirely as a breeding species over large parts of the region since historical times. Its remaining primary strongholds are in Kruger National Park (and Adjacent Private Nature Reserves), parts of Northern Cape, and, to a lesser extent, the Swaziland Lowveld and Zululand in northern KwaZulu-Natal. These strongholds are all associated with formally protected areas, with the notable exception of sparsely populated parts of Northern Cape, where it breeds fairly widely on private ranches. This large-scale historical reduction, however, seems to have stabilised in modern times and the size of the breeding population appears to have remained largely unchanged since the late 1970s at least. Indeed, there are indications of local increases in breeding pairs in some parts of the range, e.g. on private land in Northern Cape, apparently in protected areas in North West Province, and at Ithala Nature Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal. The regional population trend is stable. Confidence in this regional trend estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lappet-faced Vulture inhabits woodland regions of South Africa and Swaziland, with an apparent preference for drier woodlands, although it likely extended into other biomes ancestrally, e.g. the Karoo (Mundy et al. 1992, Mundy 1997e). Like the White-headed Vulture, it typically occurs in fairly small numbers at large carcasses, especially when compared with Gyps vultures, but is also regularly found at smaller carcasses and indeed may be more reliant on these for its regular food supply than the large carcasses which attract big numbers of Gyps vultures (Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005f). It dominates other vulture species at carcasses and is a regular kleptoparasite. The Lappet-faced Vulture, with its huge beak, seems to feed mainly on skin, meat and skin on jaw bones, tendons and ligaments at large carcasses. It appears to have a special liking for heads of animals, items other vultures are less well equipped to deal with. Lappet-faced Vultures are known to kill small animals outright but the true extent of this active predation is still unknown. The species is capable of long-distance movements, as evidenced by ring recoveries (Oatley 1998), but is not migratory (Mundy 1997e, Piper 2005f). Like other vultures, the Lappet-faced Vulture drinks and bathes regularly (Mundy 1997e).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The breeding biology of the Lappet-faced Vulture is fairly well known (Mundy et al. 1992, Piper 2005f, Tarboton 2011). The species is monogamous. The age of first breeding is at least six years. A generation length of 15 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014av). Nests are typically solitary in the region but in other areas where the species is common (or suitable breeding sites are rare and localised) nests may be loosely clustered, i.e. sometimes as close as 700 m apart. The gigantic nests are situated in the crowns of trees, are built of sticks and usually lined with grass, and are often re-used. The egg-laying period spans May-July in the region with the clutch comprising a single egg, or very rarely two eggs. Females may re-lay after early failure. Incubation is by both sexes and spans 55 days. The nestling period is 120-128 days. The post-fledging dependence period is up to a further 170 days. Breeding success is reported at 44%. The species is single brooded. Natural causes of breeding failure include predation of nestlings by African Wild Cat Felis lybica and Secretarybird Sagittarius serpentarius, as well as also possibly by Leopard Panthera pardus.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The main threats faced by the Lappet-faced Vulture are common to most of the other vulture species in southern Africa, primarily revolving around contamination of their food supply, negative interactions with humans and human infrastructure, and demand for their use in the traditional health industry. Threats reducing adult survival, relevant to many of the dangers discussed below, are of particular concern, as the population stability of this vulture, which evidences a naturally low reproductive rate, likely depends on high adult survival rates, as with other vultures.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Poisoning has proved as detrimental to this vulture as to others in the region and there are many confirmed incidents, including with substances such as strychnine, carbaryl/Gamma BHC (‘Blue-Death') and methamidophos (organophosphate), in the region (van Jaarsveld 1987, Day 1988, Mundy et al. 1992, Snyman 2000). A frightening recent development in southern Africa is the mass poisoning of vultures in the large protected area strongholds in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to help mask poaching activities, although the traditional health industry has also been implicated in at least some of these instances (Hancock 2009, 2012, Groom et al. 2013, Bradley and Maude 2014). Lappet-faced Vultures, perhaps particularly young birds, wander widely and this means that birds originating from the region could easily succumb to such incidents in the neighbouring states. The species has also been known to succumb to poison collars laced with carbofuran (Verdoorn 1999). The toxicity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, so lethal to Gyps vultures, to Lappet-faced Vultures is unknown.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Lappet-faced Vultures are also victims of electrocution on smaller pylons (van Rooyen 2000, Kruger et al. 2004) as well as collisions while in flight with overhead transmission lines (van Rooyen 2000).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Like other vulture species, the Lappet-faced Vulture is highly sought-after in the traditional medicine trade and this comprises a further major threat to the species, with birds killed using poisons and other means of hunting to satisfy this demand (Mander et al. 2007, Bamford et al. 2009a, McKean et al. 2013).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species occasionally drowns in circular concrete farm reservoirs, particularly in the dry western parts of the region (Knight 1987, Anderson et al. 1999, Herholdt and Anderson 2006) but not to same extent as the Gyps vultures. It has been suggested that poisoned vultures may be particularly prone to such drowning, as one symptom of the poisoning may be extreme thirst, and this potential association should be investigated further. The species also occasionally falls prey to gin-traps (Anderson 2000g).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A global species action plan for the Lappet-faced Vulture has been compiled (Shimelis et al. 2005). This species also falls under the ambit of the various conservation NGOs active in vulture conservation including the Bird of Prey and Wildlife and Energy programmes of the Endangered Wildlife Trust, VulPro and the IUCN Vulture Specialist Group. Education initiatives aimed at the farming community in Northern Cape has led to improved attitudes from this quarter and an increase in the number of breeding pairs in this area (Anderson and Maritz 1997). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Pylons in Northern Cape have been modified to reduce the risk of electrocution to this, and other vultures (Northern Cape Raptor Conservation Forum 2006). Collisions can be mitigated for by line-marking and judicious routing of lines, although the value of the former remains largely untested and may be inherently limited in its effectiveness related to the biological attributes of flying vultures (Jenkins et al. 2010, Martin 2011, Martin et al. 2012). A detailed assessment of the use of vultures in traditional medicine in South Africa has recently been undertaken (Mander et al. 2007, McKean et al. 2013). The danger posed by drowning in reservoirs is relatively easily ameliorated by placing objects such as logs into such structures, carefully regulating their water-levels, completely covering them or providing alternative, more suitable, drinking structures to avoid these incidents (Anderson et al. 1997, 1999). Lappet-faced Vultures benefit from supplementary feeding sites (‘vulture restaurants') in the same way as other vulture species (Butchart 1988, Piper 2004a,b, Anderson and Anthony 2006).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The key conservation measures required are similar to those needed for other vulture species in the region. These call for a focus primarily on the major threats stemming from poisoning, energy-related infrastructure, the traditional health industry, potential food shortages, drowning and negative perceptions and ignorance. Conservation efforts targeted primarily at the more abundant and widespread Cape and White-backed vultures would likely also benefit the rarer Lappet-faced Vulture. The scourge of poisoning needs to be combatted by the rigorous investigation and prosecution of all such instances, as well as the maintenance of ongoing and high-profile education and publicity campaigns emphasising the causes and negative consequences of such incidents. The legal penalties need to be severe enough to act as material deterrents. The recent trend of the mass poisoning of vultures in conservation areas to mask poaching activities and for the traditional health industry requires particular ameliorative action. A move to lead-free ammunition should be considered where relevant. Additional effort is required to reduce electrocutions and collisions of Lappet-faced Vultures related to power-line infrastructure. Existing pylons and overhead lines need to be replaced or retro-fitted, on a carefully prioritised basis, and new infrastructure needs to designed and routed, to minimise the risks from electrocution and collisions. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Pertinent to the use of Lappet-faced Vultures in the traditional health industry, an intervention strategy is required that addresses the following primary areas of action: a) reduce consumption and demand for vultures through an awareness-building campaign targeting public consumers and current roleplayers; b) change/create policy to improve regulation of the vulture trade; c) improve policing and enforcement for better regulation of the trade; d) improve understanding of the trade to allow more focused interventions, including more research and monitoring. McKean and Rushworth (2008) provide supplementary guidelines for interventions aimed at addressing the threat to vultures from traditional use. Firm steps must be maintained to confirm that the food provided at supplementary feeding sites is free from any harmful toxins. Relevant stakeholders need to be continually reminded of the threat to Lappet-faced Vultures posed by drowning the farm reservoirs. Similar ongoing action is required to control the dangers from human disturbance at breeding sites on private land.</p>

	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;Regular and accurate censuses are a high priority in order to monitor the population size and stability on an ongoing basis. This is likely best achieved using aerial censuses using fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters (Monadjem and Garcelon 2005, Howells et al. 2011, Murn et al. 2013). Such counts are already being undertaken on an annual basis in the KwaZulu-Natal protected areas where this species occurs (Howells et al. 2011).</p>

Ringing and patagial tagging (Botha 2007, Monadjem et al. 2012) can also provide information but is likely less cost effective in this regard.</p>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US"><span class="Boxies" lang="en-GB">*</span>&#9;More research is required on the ongoing impact of electrical infrastructure on Lappet-faced Vulture populations in terms of electrocutions and collisions, and on the efficacy of mitigation measures.</p>

	<h2>JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Although the global population of Southern Royal Albatross Diomedea epomophora is assumed to be stable, the species qualifies as globally Vulnerable due to its small breeding range and limited number of breeding sites which puts it at risk from stochastic effects. This species occurs regularly but in low numbers in South African territorial waters. The global threat status is also adopted as the regional status.</p>
	<h2>Reasons for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is currently listed as globally Vulnerable and occurs regularly in South African waters.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There has been substantial debate regarding the taxonomy of this species-complex. The taxon was until recently treated as the nominate subspecies of the Royal Albatross i.e. Diomedea epomophora epomophora (Ryan 2005i). Subsequently D. epomophora (Sibley and Monroe 1990) has been split into D. epomophora and D. sanfordi following Robertson and Nunn (1998) and Brooke (2004), based on morphological, plumage and genetic differences.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">107-122 cm, 7-11 kg. Sexes alike. A very large, white-backed albatross with a white head, body and tail. Flight feathers black with upperwing and coverts become increasingly white with age. Bill light pink with a black cutting edge on upper mandible. Eyes dark brown. Legs flesh-coloured. Juvenile has a white head, neck, upper mantle, rump and underparts. The white mantle is flecked black. Dark black-brown underwing with flecks on the coverts and white leading edge. Tail and back gradually whiten with age, starting at the leading edge near the shoulder (Ryan 2005i).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Royal Albatross is a New Zealand breeding endemic, with colonies present on Campbell Island (99% of the population) and the Auckland Islands. Juveniles leaving colonies in New Zealand rapidly head eastwards to the west coast of South America (Tickell 2000).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at c. 27 500 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014aw). The Campbell Island population was estimated at 7 855 breeding pairs between 2004-2008 (ACAP 2009d). In 2001, 69 pairs were present on Enderby Island (Childerhouse et al. 2003) and approximately 20 breed on Auckland and Adams islands (Croxall and Gales 1998). Based on the ratio used by Croxall and Gales (1998), an estimate of c. 7 900 annual breeding pairs (equivalent to c. 27 200 mature individuals) is provided. Confidence in this estimate is high. The number visiting South African waters is unknown. </p>
	<h2>Trend justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Overall the population is thought to be stable and possibly increasing (BirdLife International 2014aw). The population on Campbell Island is likely to be stable or possibly increasing, based on whole-island counts conducted in 1994-1995 and study plot counts in 1996-1997 (Moore et al. 1997). More recent comprehensive counts in 2005-2008 reported an average of nearly 8 000 nests per year, another indication of a stable population (ACAP 2009d). The status of the very small colonies on the Adams and Auckland islands is not known (ACAP 2009d). Confidence in this trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ecology </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Royal Albatross is a biennial breeder provided it is successful in rearing the single chick. Birds return to their colonies in October (Brooke 2004) and lay eggs in late November and December (Waugh et al. 1997). Immature birds first return to their colonies at c. 5 years of age (Marchant and Higgins 1990) and their first breeding attempt occurs between 6-12 years of age (Childerhouse et al. 2003). The diet of the Southern Royal Albatross consists of primarily cephalopods, fish and tunicates (mostly of the family Salpidae) which is known from regurgitations of fledglings and adults on Campbell Island from 1974-177 and 1990-1997 (Imber 1999). This species obtains its prey from scavenging on dying or moribund prey from fishing vessels and to a lesser extent by active predation (Imber 1999).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are currently few land-based threats to Southern Royal Albatrosses that would result in population-level changes and all breeding sites are legally protected (ACAP 2009d). Reductions in populations were experienced until the 1930s due to human predation, farming and introduced mammals, causing the populations on Enderby and Auckland islands to become extinct by the 1800s (Heather and Robertson 2000). A scrub known as Dracophyllum is spreading, possibly due to climate warming, and may reduce the amount of suitable breeding habitat available to the birds on Campbell and Enderby Islands (Wilmshurst et al. 2004). A decrease in population size from between 1970-1980s coincided with the peak in longline fishing in the New Zealand area (Moore and Bettany 2005). Southern Royal Albatrosses are occasionally accidentally caught by longline and trawl fishery operations around New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile (Gales et al. 1998, Favero et al. 2003, Waugh and Weimerskirch 2003, Sullivan et al. 2006, Thompson 2010) as well as by Japanese tuna longliners on the high seas (Kiyota and Minami 2001). Petersen et al. (2009a) reported this species being caught in demersal longline fishery operations off southern Africa. Brown Rats Rattus norvegicus were reported to kill chicks on Campbell Island (Taylor 2000c) but were eradicated in 2003. Approximately 99% of the Southern Royal Albatross population breeds on Campbell Island (ACAP 2009d) which poses a serious potential threat, as nearly the entire global population may be affected should a disaster occur on this island.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is listed on ACAP Annex 1 and the Conservation on Migratory Species Appendix II. Cattle and sheep have been removed from Campbell Island, and cattle, rabbits and mice have been eradicated from Enderby Island. Rats have been eradicated from Campbell Island in 2001 and an expedition in 2003 found no evidence of them persisting (Towns and Broome 2003). Within the region, the species is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Publication of Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries 2008. Albatross Task Force teams are working in eight countries (Peru, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Chile and South Africa and Namibia) to reduce fisheries bycatch in local trawl and longline fisheries.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The establishment of observer programmes to monitor bycatch and effectiveness of bycatch mitigation measures is essential. The extension of mandatory seabird bycatch mitigation measures to distant water fleets/high seas fisheries is required. A 10-year interval census of the Campbell and Enderby island colonies is required, and vegetation change on these islands should be monitored and its effect on breeding birds should be assessed. Pigs and cats should be eradicated from Auckland Island (Taylor 2000c). Finally, it should be ensured that all countries necessary have a plan of action for seabirds which is enforced and updated regularly.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans has been quantified at c. 3 650 pairs that breed at two locations within the region namely Prince Edward Island and Marion Island. The global population is listed as Vulnerable due to past declines. In addition, the species satisfies the population criterion for regionally Vulnerable under criterion D2 (restricted to fewer than five locations within the region).</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is listed as globally Vulnerable, breeds on the Prince Edward Islands and occurs regularly within 200 nm of South Africa.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans (s.l.) has been the subject of longstanding taxonomic debate (Nunn et al. 1996). The major albatross phylogenetic revisions of the 1990s settled the taxonomy into four species of wandering-type albatrosses, including Tristan (D. dabbenena), Antipodean (D. antipodensis), Amsterdam (D. amsterdamensis) and Wandering (D. exulans). The two royal albatrosses form a discrete clade within the genus (Nunn et al. 1996).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">110-135 cm, 7.4-9.4 kg. An extremely large, hump-backed albatross. Sexes alike although the male is slightly larger and develops white adult plumage faster. Wide varieties of plumages occur: younger birds appear darker while older males are typically entirely white with the exception of black flight feathers. The bill is pink and tipped creamy yellow while the legs and feet are a pinkish horn in colour. Adults often have a pinkish crescent on the side of their necks, which is absent from royal albatrosses (Tickell 2000, Ryan 2005j).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species has a circumpolar distribution across the Southern Ocean, seldom venturing into continental shelf waters (Ryan 2005j). It breeds at 19 different sites including South Georgia, the Prince Edward Islands, the Crozet Archipelago, the Kerguelen Islands and Macquarie Island (ACAP 2009d). The three island groups in the Indian Ocean sector, namely Crozet, Kerguelen, and the Prince Edward islands, together account for approximately 82% of the global population. Birds forage up to 4 000 km away from breeding colonies and foraging strategies change throughout the breeding season (Weimerskirch and Jouventin 1998). Birds ringed at South Georgia, Marion Island and Crozet Island have been recovered in South Africa (Morant et al. 1983, Weimerskirch et al. 1985). Post-breeding adults from South Georgia initially head north to forage, later turning east to South African waters (Prince et al. 1998). Some birds stay close to the African continent while others continue eastwards to Australia.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the Wandering Albatross has been quantified at c. 16 000 mature individuals (ACAP 2009e). Approximately 7 000 mature individuals, or 44% of the global population, breed on the Prince Edward Islands with c. 1 850 pairs breeding on Marion Island (2007) and c. 1 800 breeding pairs on Prince Edward Island (2009), respectively (Ryan et al. 2009a). The total number of birds on the Prince Edward Islands is c. 3 650 pairs. The confidence in this regional population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Globally, long-term population studies have been conducted on all five island groups where this species breeds. All populations have shown decreases over the past 25 years (ACAP 2009e). On a regional basis, the well-monitored Marion Island sub-population decreased at roughly 1.5% per year from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, to reach a level of c. 1 500 pairs. This downward trend reversed from the late-1980s through to around the new millennium at a rate of 5.5% per year, peaking at c. 1 800 pairs (Nel et al. 2002a,b, Ryan et al. 2009a). The overall rate of population increase since 1975 has been less than 0.5% per year (ACAP 2009e) although breeding success has fallen from an average of 74.6% between 1985 and 2001 (Nel et al. 2003) to 67.7% in 2002-2007. Long-term census data have not been collected on Prince Edward Island but trends are thought to mirror those of Marion Island (Nel et al. 2002a, Ryan et al. 2009a). The confidence in this population trend estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Wandering Albatross is a biennial breeding species, although approximately 30% of successful and 35% of failed breeders defer breeding beyond the expected year (Prince et al. 1998). The total breeding season just exceeds one year (ACAP 2009e). The provided generation length of 23.3 years was calculated based on a published estimate of mean age at first breeding and a published estimate of mean annual survival (BirdLife International 2014ax). The species is mainly a diurnal feeder, but about 20% of the diet is taken at night (Phalan et al. 2007). Most of its prey is obtained by surface-seizing (Prince et al. 1994). The diet of birds in southern African waters is little known, but birds breeding on Marion Island were recorded to consume 40-77% squid (by mass) and 15-42% fish, with crustaceans, carrion, tunicates and jellyfish making up the remainder (Cherel and Klages 1998). The species is a well-known ship follower, competing for offal and discards from trawl and longline vessels (Ryan 2005j).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to the Wandering Albatross is incidental mortality sustained during interactions with longline vessels (Nel et al. 2002b). A decline in the global population in the mid-1980s was linked to an increase in longline fishing operations targeting Southern Bluefin Tuna Thunnus maccoyii in the Southern Ocean (Nel et al. 2002b). Despite the implementation of technologies aimed at reducing bycatch, this species is still captured in high-seas longline fisheries, and any changes in longline fishing effort or spatial distribution could bring about a renewed threat to the Wandering Albatross. The longer-term effects of demographic skews in bycatch rates may also retard recovery (Ryan and Boix-Hinzen 1998, 1999, Mills and Ryan 2005). However, it should be noted that this species is very seldom killed in the South African longline fishery (Petersen et al. 2009a), and the primary area of concern is from vessels fishing on the high seas. Low levels of predation on albatross chicks by House Mice Mus musculus on Marion Island is a recent phenomenon and constitutes an emerging threat (Wanless et al. 2007, Jones and Ryan 2010). There are no known threats at Prince Edward Island itself. The secondary ingestion of marine debris, such as discarded hooks, can have an impact on chicks (Nel et al. 2002c).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">BirdLife South Africa's Albatross Task force is actively researching new technologies to reduce incidental mortality in fisheries. It also monitors observer data and estimates annual bycatch in selected fisheries and promotes the development and enforcement of best-practice to reduce incidental mortality. It supports the construction and distribution of devices such as Bird Scaring Lines for fishing vessels. BirdLife International is actively lobbying regional fisheries management organisations, particularly the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, to improve the conservation measures required of longline fishing vessels. It is also supporting moves to create regional observer programmes, and strengthen observer data collection and reporting procedures. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In 2011, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna passed a resolution requiring the use of two out of three proven measures to reduce seabird bycatch in all longline vessels fishing south of 25°S. This was followed in 2012 by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission with a near-identical measure. South Africa requires that longline vessels flagged to them or fishing under joint-venture agreements in the Exclusive Economic Zone use all three of the above measures, although compliance with line-weighting requirements is equivocal. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Regionally, the Wandering Albatross receives protection in South Africa under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Publication of Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch on Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (2008). The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ongoing measures by BirdLife South Africa and BirdLife International, to improve pelagic longline fishing operations and reduce incidental mortality of seabirds should be supported and extended to distant fishing nations operating in the Southern Ocean. The South African Government should promote international best-practice for reducing seabird mortalities at bodies such as the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. Regional and national observer programmes and reporting of their data remain of paramount importance in understanding the scale of incidental mortality and potential effectiveness of (and level of compliance with) mitigation measures employed. Programmes to survey the sub-population at Prince Edward Island regularly and tracking birds to assess degree of overlap with various fisheries remain important tools for assessing and addressing the ongoing threats from fishery interactions. The eradication of the House Mouse from Marion Island is a priority. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The taxonomically intriguing Bush Blackcap Lioptilus nigricapillus is an elusive, localised, regional endemic. It is suspected to have undergone a decline of 30% over a fifteen-year period, and is consequently assessed as regionally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Bush Blackcap is endemic to the region and was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000. The species is currently listed as globally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There has been much debate concerning the taxonomic relationship of the Bush Blackcap with previous opinions suggesting affinities with babblers (Timaliidae) or bulbuls (Pycnonotidae). However, it is in fact a sylviid babbler/warbler (Sylviidae), allied to the Pseudoalcippe hill babblers. The species is monotypic (Clancey 1980).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">16-18 cm, 30 g. Sexes alike. Distinctive black cap and nape, together with coral bill, diagnostic. Upperparts, including upperwing coverts, brown. Flight feathers olive-brown with pale grey edged primaries. Underparts from throat to belly pale grey. Flanks, thighs and undertail coverts pale brown. Legs and feet pale pink (Lloyd 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Bush Blackcap is endemic to the region, occurring from the north-eastern Eastern Cape, through the lower foothills and mistbelt forests of KwaZulu-Natal, the eastern Free State, western Swaziland and Mpumalanga in a band of 750-1 825 masl, hugging the escarpment (Oatley 1997a). Within this area, it shows a distinct preference for stands of Ouhout Leucosidea sericea and different sagewood species Buddleja spp. (Barnes 2000h) as well edges of Afromontane forests (Lloyd 2005a). The species is an altitudinal migrant, descending from high altitudes in winter to within 50 km of the coast (MR Taylor pers. obs.). Occasional records from the central and south-eastern Free State (Earlé and Grobler 1987) and with increasing frequency around Johannesburg, Gauteng (Selfe 1999, Pienaar 2000) may represent unusually extensive altitudinal migration or juvenile dispersal (Lloyd 2005a), or perhaps pioneering colonisation efforts of Gauteng's ‘urban forest' during the non-breeding season. While its EoO has decreased only slightly, the AoO has decreased by 34% to 37 200 km2. Its very specific ecological requirements mean that only 2% of this range represents suitable breeding habitat, equating to a more realistic AoO of just 744 km2. It should be noted that the extensive post-breeding movements of the Bush Blackcap may over-inflate its estimated AoO. The species is reported from 22 IBAs in the region, and is well represented in the protected areas network.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Siegfried (1992) estimated the global population at 1 500-5 000 birds with 500-1 000 occurring in protected areas. Parker (1994) provides a figure of 40 birds for Swaziland while Monadjem et al. (2003) suggested an updated figure of 40-60 individuals. It should be noted that the majority of the Swaziland records are from the winter months (Monadjem et al. 2003) indicating a seasonal influx from higher altitudes in South Africa. The regional population is estimated to be between 1500 and 3 000 mature individuals. Confidence in this population estimate is low and it requires verification.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population is suspected to be in decline owing to ongoing habitat destruction and fragmentation (BirdLife International 2014ay). The three-generation period of 15 years (BirdLife International 2014ay) is similar to the gap between atlas periods. Based on a decline in the AoO between the current and previous atlas projects, it is suspected that the species has undergone a decline in the region of 30%. However, confidence in this trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Solitary, but pairs up in the breeding season (Oatley 1997a). Preferred breeding habitat is verges of Afromontane forests and pockets of precursor forest, often on the fringes of the forest as opposed to the interior (Maclean 1993, Tarboton 2001). Lays 2-3 eggs from October to January, peaking in November (Tarboton 2001). Due to its seasonal altitudinal movements, the species' breeding range is significantly smaller than the AoO figure provided. A generation length of 4.8 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014ay). Little is known of its diet; MacLean (1993) mentions that it is predominantly frugivorous although Taylor and Bucknill (1907) make mention that it is insectivorous after examining the stomach contents of a collected specimen.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The severity of threats facing the Bush Blackcap have not been fully investigated, and concerns for its conservation stem mostly from its naturally small range, restricted and fragmented habitat and low densities. The continuation of forestry on the breeding grounds of the Bush Blackcap in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga poses a major threat in the form of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation. In the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, commercial afforestation and agriculture (both commercial and subsistence), as well as urban development, have badly affected the wintering grounds of this species. The potential effects of climate change on the Bush Blackcap should be assessed.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific measures are in place. However, the establishment of the Maloti-Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site has aided in the conservation of a major portion of the species' breeding stronghold. Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, the Department of Economic Development, Environmental Affairs and Tourism (KwaZulu-Natal) and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry have signed a Memorandum of Understanding in KwaZulu-Natal to ensure that indigenous forest patches and the surrounding ecotonal buffer are managed co-operatively so as to ensure that any proposed development has a minimal effect thereon.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Apart from continuing protection of Afromontane forest patches, conservation measures pertaining specifically to the Bush Blackcap can only be proposed once the threats facing the species, and the reasons behind its apparent decline in range and abundance, have been analysed.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of African Broadbill Smithornis capensis exceeds the thresholds for regionally Vulnerable under the population-size criterion (less than10 000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be greater than 10% in 10 years or three generations). </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of African Broadbill occurs in the region. In addition, the decrease in AoO coupled with the fact that the species was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000, qualified it for the 2015 assessment.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is sometimes considered to form a  superspecies with the Rufous-sided Broadbill S. rufolateralis, but appears to be more closely related to the Grey-headed Broadbill S. sharpei. The highly disjunct and fragmented distributions of the various populations complicate delineation of ranges of subspecies. Nine races were recognised by Bruce (2003), who cautioned that a revision of the taxonomy of the various subspecies is needed. At present, two races are thought to occur in South Africa, with the nominate capensis occurring from Port Shepstone in the south to St. Lucia in the north of KwaZulu-Natal, and cryptoleucus occurring disjunctly from northern Maputaland to north-eastern Limpopo. However, the isolated population in north-eastern Limpopo Province may represent a distinct race (Bruce 2003). </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">14 cm, 28 g. Small, resembling a plump, large-headed sparrow, with a distinctive broad, dorso-ventrally flattened bill with a large gape (as reflected in the common name). Legs short but toes relatively long and syndactylous. Bill black above and pale whitish-pink below, fringed basally by conspicuous rictal bristles. The male has a buff-grey forehead with sooty black crown. Nape and ear coverts greyish brown with indistinct blackish streaks. Chin and throat white, diffusely streaked brownish black. Mantle and back greyish brown, streaked black and white on the mantle. Feathers of mantle and upper back have white feather bases, which are usually concealed, but become visible during display flight. Rump, uppertail coverts, and tail brown. Breast and belly creamy white, flanks more yellowish. Heavily streaked black on breast and flanks, but not on belly. Undertail coverts white. Median wing coverts with distinct creamy or buff tips, forming wing-bar. Flight feathers mostly dark brown; silvery grey below. Iris dark brown. Legs and feet greenish grey. Female slightly larger and duller than male with buffy forehead and lores, and greyish brown crown with black streaks. Juvenile resembles female, but has a stronger yellow wash dorsally and ventrally, and lacks dark markings on the back; less buff on forehead than female, with indistinct streaking on brown crown (Vernon and Dean 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Broadbill is endemic to the Afrotropics with isolated populations occurring in West Africa from Sierra Leone to northern Angola, with the species more widespread in east, central and southern Africa (Vernon and Dean 2005a). In southern Africa, it occurs from the Okavango Delta, Botswana, and the Caprivi, Namibia, in the west, to the middle Zambezi Valley and the eastern slopes of Zimbabwe's Eastern Highlands to southern Mozambique in the east (Vernon and Dean 2005a). The only recent records in Swaziland are from Hlane Royal National Park.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In South Africa, the distribution is highly fragmented with scattered populations in north-eastern Limpopo, Swaziland and north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal, and southwards to the Port Shepstone region in southern KwaZulu-Natal (Allan 2000b). In Limpopo, Tarboton, Kemp and Kemp (1987) mentioned two records from Venda: one from Thate Vondo Forest and another from the Mutshindudu River Valley, but there are no recent records from these localities. The species was not recorded in Limpopo during SABAP1 and this sub-population was only ‘rediscovered' in 1999, near Luvhuvu (Symes and Perrin 2000). The Limpopo sub-population appears to be restricted to the Luvhuvu River catchment and is known from Roodewal, Entabeni, Luvhuvu and Golwe.  </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In KwaZulu-Natal, there has been a range reduction in the extreme north of the province. The species still appears to be common in the St. Lucia, Hluhluwe and Mfolozi areas. The nominate race appears to have disappeared from much of its former range around Durban and much of the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal, having only been recorded at four isolated localities during SABAP2: Oribi Gorge, Vernon Crookes, Entumeni and Nhlabane. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified, but is believed to number greater than 10 000 mature individuals. At first glance, the increased EoO estimate derived from SABAP2 suggests a range expansion of the regional population, due to the rediscovery of an isolated population in north-eastern Limpopo in the late 1990s (Symes and Perrin 2000) which was not included in Allan's (2000b) assessment. No regional population estimate is provided by Allan (2000b) or Vernon and Dean (2005), but it is estimated that less than2 500 mature individuals currently occur in the region. The confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The status of the global population is unknown. A comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 reporting rates shows that during SABAP2 data gathering, the species was not reported from 16 of the quarter-degree grid cells in which it was recorded in SABAP1, and there is a higher reporting rate in SABAP1 compared to SABAP2 in five quarter-degree grid cells. Conversely, African Broadbills were recorded in nine quarter-degree grid cells in SABAP2, from which it was not reported during SABAP1. Three of these are from the population in north-eastern Limpopo. The AoO gives a clearer indication, showing a c. 13% decrease in AoO compared to the most recent regional assessment (Allan 2000b). Based upon this, a downward population trend is inferred which is estimated to be greater than 10% over the next three generations (16.6 years). Confidence in this regional population trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species utilises under- and lower storeys of a variety of wooded vegetation types, including scarp, coastal, evergreen and riparian forests, Sand Forest, dense savannah/woodland deciduous thickets, miombo woodland and areas with bamboo stands (Fry et al. 1988, Bruce 2003, Vernon and Dean 2005a). It also occurs in disturbed areas with a mosaic of forest and scrub, montane forest patches, cultivation, and in open, scrubby areas near villages (Bruce 2003). The two South African subspecies appear to inhabit two different types of forest (Allan 2000b): the nominate race inhabits coastal scarp and lowland forest from Port Shepstone in the south to St. Lucia in the north of KwaZulu-Natal, and the race S. c. cryptoleucus inhabits Sand Forest in the northern parts of St. Lucia, Ironwood Androstachys johnsonii forest in the Lebombo Mountain range, and subtropical moist thickets in north-eastern Limpopo.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The major threat is habitat destruction through rural and urban expansion and agriculture. This has led to the disappearance of the nominate race from much of its former range in KwaZulu-Natal. Locally, commercial and subsistence deforestation cause habitat destruction. At Golwe, in north-eastern Limpopo, breeding success is poor (Engelbrecht and Nethonzhe 2008) and vervet monkeys Chlorocebus pygerythrus attracted to the edges of villages are responsible for the loss of the majority of nests (GD Engelbrecht and C Nethonzhe, unpubl. data).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation measures are currently underway. Research on the ecology, distribution and conservation of the north-eastern Limpopo population is being conducted by the University of Limpopo.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Species Action Plan is recommended. All known populations should be monitored on an annual basis, to form the basis for conservation actions. The continuous fragmentation of existing habitat needs to be monitored and, wherever possible halted or reversed as a matter of urgency. Urgent conservation action is also required for the species in KwaZulu-Natal, and particularly concerning the nominate race in the southern parts of the species' range.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Denham's Bustard Neotis denhami is suspected to be undergoing a decline of greater than 30% over a three generation period (50.5 years) which qualifies the species as regionally Vulnerable. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global population occurs within the region. In addition, the species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and globally Near Threatened in 2013. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Three subspecies are differentiated, based mainly on wing length and intensity of rufous colouration on the hind-neck (Allan 2005d): north of the equator, the nominate denhami occurs from Gambia to Uganda and Ethiopia; jacksoni occurs from Kenya to Zambia and Angola, and as far south as central Mozambique, north-west Zimbabwe, northern Botswana and northern Namibia; finally stanleyi (formerly known regionally as Stanley's Bustard) is near-endemic to South Africa, extending marginally into Mozambique. The species is sometimes placed in the genus Ardeotis.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">100-120 cm, 3.7-7.6 kg. A large, impressive bustard with striking black-and-white patterning on the wing coverts and remiges. Sexes dimorphic in plumage colouration and male further distinguished by its slightly larger size and thicker neck. Adult male has black crown, broad white supercilium, narrow blackish eye-stripe and bluish grey face. Throat white with foreneck and upper breast bluish grey and lower breast white. In astonishing ‘balloon' display, inflates neck and flares normally concealed white neck and breast plumes. Hind-neck and upper mantle deep chestnut; lower mantle, back and rump brown with fine black vermiculations. Tail blackish brown with 2-3 broad, creamy white bands. Upperwing coverts and inner primaries boldly pied; lesser wing coverts vermiculated blackish brown. Underparts, including flanks and undertail, white. Males distinguished from females by unmarked white or grey fore-neck and breast as well as plainer upperparts (Urban et al. 1986, Allan 2002). Fore-neck and upper breast of female finely barred with sharply demarcated white underparts (Allan 2005d).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Denham's Bustard has a wide but fragmented Afrotropical range, occurring in a band stretching from Mauritania to Ethiopia, and southwards through Kenya, Tanzania, southern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia to northern Botswana; it is a non-breeding visitor to Angola and Congo (see also Taxonomy). Within the region, an isolated population occurs widely but sparsely over much of mesic eastern half of South Africa, from the Overberg in Western Cape through Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal to the high-lying grasslands of Mpumalanga, with an outlying sub-population in Limpopo Province.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In Western Cape, Denham's Bustard can be locally numerous in mosaics of cultivated pastures, agricultural croplands and natural vegetation with clear seasonal differences in the use of each habitat type (Allan 2002). In Eastern Cape, Clancey (1972) described its range as the coastal and sub-coastal belt, extending to the Karoo Midlands, and noted that it occurred seasonally on the upland grassveld of East Griqualand. The species is uncommon in Free State, occurring only in the extreme north-eastern Highveld of that province (Maclean 1957, Herholdt 1988). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Denham's Bustard is widespread in KwaZulu-Natal, where it is found in both upland grasslands and low-lying coastal grasslands of north-eastern Zululand and adjacent Mozambique (Cyrus and Robson 1980). The sour grassveld areas of Mpumalanga, from Wakkerstroom to Dullstroom, and westwards to the border of Gauteng, hold several populations. At the northern extremes of its range, fragmented populations persist in the Graskop area above the Blyde River Canyon, as well as on the grassy plateau of the Waterberg in Limpopo Province (Kemp et al. 1985). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">It avoids the dry western and central parts of South Africa, and occasional (erroneous) claims from the Karoo are attributable to the similarity of Ludwig's N. ludwigii and Denham's bustards (Herholdt 1988); in reality the latter occurs there only as a vagrant or along ecotones where the Karoo meets the Grassland and Fynbos biomes (Allan 2002). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species occurs marginally in Swaziland, where it is restricted to the western Highveld regions, with breeding records from Malolotja National Park. It is considered a non-breeding vagrant to Lesotho (Osborne and Tigar 1990). Birds have been reported moving to lower-lying areas during winter, but this has not been confirmed (Herholdt 1988). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014az) and no current regional estimate exists. Tarboton et al. (1987) estimated there to be less than300 individuals in the former Transvaal Province. Brooke (1984) provided a figure of between 100-200 birds in Eastern Cape although Allan (2002) mentioned that the species is rare or absent from most of the former Transkei with a small population persisting at Luchaba Nature Reserve near Mthatha (Quickelberge 1989). Allan (2002) provided a population estimate of 956 birds in the ‘southern Cape'. Boycott and Parker (2003) estimated that 10-30 breeding pairs occur in Malolotja National Park, Swaziland. Taking this into account, Allan (2002) estimated the regional population at less than5 000 mature individuals. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Density varies according to habitat. Mendelsohn (1978) reported a density of 0.05-0.08 birds/km2 in the Springbok Flats area of Limpopo Province, while Tarboton (1989) recorded a density of 0.78 birds/km2 in the Steenkampsberg near Dullstroom, Mpumalanga. Barnes (1998a) provides a density estimate of 0.5-1.0 birds/km2 while Allan (2002) reported winter density estimates of 0.04 birds/km2 for the Overberg district of Western Cape, one of the remaining strongholds of this species. A comparison of the EoO between the two atlas periods reveals a slight increase of 1.4% (to 899 620 km2) but the AoO has decreased alarmingly by 39.26% to 117 451 km2. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Declines in the species' range, and correspondingly regional populations, have been reported from Kenya, Sudan and Nigeria (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Within the region, several authors make mention that the species has decreased in numbers and range (Herholdt 1988, Tarboton 1989). The exact rate of decline is unknown although the species may be decreasing at a rate of greater than 30% over three generations. The confidence in this regional population trend estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Denham's Bustard is usually encountered alone or in small groups of c. 2-7 birds although occasional aggregations as large as 28 individuals have been reported (Allan 2002). Displaying male Denham's Bustards were recorded in the Overberg region of Western Cape between August and December with egg-laying taking place in September to October (Allan 2002). Unfledged young were recorded between September and January. Group sizes in this area were significantly smaller in the breeding season (September-January) than in the non-breeding season (Allan 2002). Both sexes tend to form single-sex groups when flocking (Allan 2002). Groups containing a single male and female are rare, indicating a possible polygamous mating system (Allan 2002) as is usual for bustards (Johnsgard and Jones 1991). A generation length of 10.3 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014az). The species is omnivorous.</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Denham's Bustard faces a wide range of threats in the region. Collisions with power-lines have been identified as a major threat to the species (Shaw et al. 2010a). Habitat loss through commercial afforestation of the sour grasslands of the former Transvaal and western Highveld regions of Swaziland (Allan et al. 1997b, Allan 2002, Monadjem et al. 2003), as well as the midlands of KwaZulu-Natal (Johnson 1992) is a moderate threat. Monoculture and intensive crop farming was considered to constitute a threat by Herholdt (1988) and Tarboton (1989). Overgrazing in Swaziland has also been identified as a cause of habitat loss impacting upon this species (Monadjem et al. 2003). Hunting has been cited as a cause for the decline of some populations (Quickelberge 1989) and Mendelsohn (1978) proposed that snaring is a specific threat to Ludwig's and Denham's bustards.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is listed under Appendix II of CITES. It is also listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No 7 of 2003, and as Endangered under the Swaziland Game Act. Following a strategic workshop in 2009, the Bustard Working Group was established with the support of Birdlife South Africa, to assess the growing cause for concern over the conservation of South Africa's ten bustard and korhaan species. Valuable population data is generated through biannual censuses conducted via the Coordinated Avifaunal Roadcount (CAR) Project.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The rate of decline of the regional Denham's Bustard population is unknown and at risk of being undocumented. Slow, inadequately monitored declines over long periods tend to go unrecognised with a result of inadequate conservation measures being put in place. Improvements in the protected area network, ostensibly through biodiversity stewardship models, within Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces would assist in ameliorating the impacts of habitat loss within its core range. Improved management of fires and grazing regimes should be considered in conservation areas and on private land, in order to create heterogeneity in the structural and floristic components of preferred habitats. Work being undertaken by stakeholders in the power transmission sector must continue to focus on abating the threat of collisions to this species.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The scarce and nomadic Burchell's Courser Cursorius rufus is under-recorded in remote parts of its range; however, a 30% decrease in AoO, and a concurrent population decrease, qualifies it as regionally Vulnerable under criteria A2c and A4c. Accurate population estimates are not available, but it is likely that the regional population is less than10 000 mature individuals with an estimated, continuing decline of at least 10% over the next three generations, the requirement for Vulnerable under C1. Furthermore, the scattered and severely fragmented distribution range suggests that no sub-population contains more than 1 000 mature individuals, as set out in criterion C2a(i).</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of the species occurs within the region. In addition, the species has undergone a greater than 30% decrease in AoO since the SABAP1 reporting period.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two subspecies have been described; birds east of 21°E being ascribed to the nominate C. r. rufus, and birds from Bushmanland, Namibia and Angola to C. r. theresae (Maclean and Herremans 1997a). The latter is overall paler, with a purer blue nape and narrower dark belly-band. However, most authors now consider the species to be monotypic (Lloyd 2005b). Previously, coursers of the forms littoralis and somalensis from arid north-east Africa were considered synonymous with Burchell's Courser; however, these are now amalgamated under a different species, Somali Courser C. somalensis, which in turn is distinct from the Cream-coloured Courser C. cursor of North Africa and the Middle East (Sinclair et al. 2003). In addition to their highly disjunct distribution ranges, C. rufus and C. somalensis differ in underwing colour, belly markings, juvenile plumage and vocalisations (Hockey and Douie 1995). </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">20-22 cm. A medium-sized, terrestrial wader usually encountered in pairs or family groups. The sexes are alike, but males are slightly larger and heavier than females. Sandy to rufous-brown above, with a richer tawny-brown forehead. Hind-crown blue-grey (diagnostic). White eye-surround extends back behind eye in a broad white line, meeting on the nape in a nuchal collar forming a V-shape, bordered above and below by narrow black bands. Throat whitish. Foreneck and upper breast pinkish buff to sandy brown, sharply demarcated from white belly by a transverse black band. Flanks and undertail coverts white. Tail ashy brown, with white tips and dark sub-terminal spots. In flight, shows black primaries and primary coverts, and grey-brown secondaries with white inner webs and white tips, the latter forming a white band on the trailing edge of the inner wing. Bill grey-black, longish and clearly decurved. Eyes dark brown. Legs long, off-white. Juvenile more mottled above and below, with barred tail, less defined belly markings and face pattern, and mottled (not blue-grey) nape (Urban et al. 1986, Hockey and Douie 1995, Rosair and Cottridge 2004).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Burchell's Courser is near-endemic to southern Africa. It occurs widely but erratically in a highly fragmented pattern over much of the arid interior of South Africa and higher parts of the inland plateau, excluding Lesotho (Maclean and Herremans 1997a). Extra-limitally, it is reasonably numerous and widespread in southern and western Namibia, especially along the eastern edge of the Namib and in Kaokoland, extending marginally into south-western Angola. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In South Africa, which encapsulates c. 40-60% of this courser's global distribution, both its range and abundance have declined dramatically in the past 50-150 years, with marked decreases in numbers or local extinctions in many areas. In the late 1800s, it was described as abundant on the Highveld of eastern South Africa (Stark and Sclater 1903), and it was still plentiful around Potchefstroom (the type locality) in the early 1930s (Lane 1933), which represents the last case of breeding in the former Transvaal province (Maclean and Herremans 1997a). By the 1980s it was described as widely but sparsely and erratically recorded in the Transvaal, and possibly only present during drought years (Tarboton et al. 1987). It is now entirely absent from the northern parts of South Africa, with the exception of rare reports of transient, non-breeding and usually single birds, such as near Middelburg (1968), Pafuri (1980), and Beestekraal (c. 1980). A similarly worrying decrease occurred since the 1970s in KwaZulu-Natal, where it no longer occurs (Cyrus and Robson 1980, Maclean and Herremans 1997a). Few recent records come from Eastern Cape, where the species was a locally common breeder until the 1940s. Records in northern and eastern Free State, where the species was previously considered common, are now almost negligible. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">SABAP2 records show that it still persists in scattered locations in the dry interior, with concentrations of records in south-western Free State, Northern Cape and North West. However, it was recorded in few adjacent pentads, and the relatively large, contiguous populations apparent in the SABAP1 dataset appear to have become smaller and fragmented, but this impression may change as SABAP2 coverage of the interior improves. The species was previously considered a regular non-breeding migrant to the wheat-fields of Western Cape (Hockey and Douie 1995), but was not recorded there during the SABAP2 reporting period.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global and regional populations of Burchell's Courser have not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014ba). Obtaining accurate regional population estimates is very challenging owing to the vast, sparsely populated landscapes inhabited by this species, and the fact that its movements are poorly understood. It appears to be resident in some areas, given that environmental conditions remain suitable, but possibly undertakes regular migratory movements in parts of its range; however, as in many other arid-country species, it apparently also undergoes large-scale migratory wandering, and occasionally irrupts outside of its normal range. Nevertheless, the species is nowhere abundant, and even in the core of its current range, it remains elusive and localised. The size of the regional population is unknown, but is almost certainly less than10 000 mature individuals. Confidence in this estimate is low and needs to be improved upon.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Several authorities have expressed the view that the rapid range contraction and population reduction of this species is cause for concern, and that the near-endemic Burchell's Courser should be considered a conservation priority (Maclean and Herremans 1997a, Lloyd 2005b), particularly because the underlying causes of these declines are not currently understood. A c. 77% reduction in AoO between the two atlasing periods is apparent, and this suggests that a concurrent population decline of similar scale has also likely occurred. However, due to the fact that this species is certainly under-recorded in large sections of its range, a less severe decline of 30-50% within the past 10 years is more realistic. Furthermore, it is projected that this species will continue to decline by greater than 10% over the next three generations or 21.9 years (BirdLife International 2014ba). Confidence in this regional population trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Like the sympatric Double-banded Courser Rhinoptilus africanus, Burchell's Courser shows a preference for open, desert and semi-desert habitats, often occurring in the most sparsely vegetated areas available (Cohen and Spottiswoode 2000). Typical habitats include heavily grazed or burnt grassland, stony or gravelly plains, stubbly sandveld, dry riverbeds and edges of saline pans (Hockey and Douie 1995, Maclean and Herremans 1997a). Historically it may have been associated with large ungulate herds, and it is still regularly seen in the vicinity of wild ungulate herds and to some extent, domestic grazers, for example, around stock watering points. It occasionally makes use of ploughed fields or cereal croplands with small emerging seedlings (Lloyd 2005b).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The nature, extent and causes of the rapid decline in the range of Burchell's Courser are poorly understood (Maclean and Herremans 1997a). Habitat loss is likely to be a significant contributor. Intensification of agriculture, and the accompanying use of irrigation, pesticides and fertilisers, and the shift from pastures to croplands possibly plays a role (Hockey and Douie 1995, Lloyd 2005b). The species' historic range is likely to have contracted because of the reduction in the number of wild grazing ungulates, but this is partly compensated for by animal husbandry. The potential effects of climate change and desertification on Burchell's Courser have not been fully investigated; climate change is expected to impact heavily on species that inhabit the arid Nama Karoo and Succulent Karoo biomes (Simmons et al. 2004); however, its nomadic nature will possibly allow Burchell's Courser to cope with shifting biomes and climatic conditions.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As this species was not previously considered a conservation priority, no conservation actions are currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">It is difficult to recommend targeted conservation measures before an in-depth understanding of the ecological requirements of this species is obtained, and the reasons for its suspected range and population decline are understood. Its long-term survival will likely be in the hands of private land-owners, and awareness campaigns and biodiversity stewardship programmes would be beneficial. Continued monitoring is essential: parts of the range remain unsurveyed or under-explored due to their remoteness, inhospitable climate and poorly developed infrastructure. Observers can be encouraged to visit such areas through coordinated atlasing expeditions, or through the provision of funding by atlas projects or conservation agencies. As Burchell's Courser is marginal in Angola, virtually extinct in Botswana, and at most a vagrant to Lesotho, its conservation is the sole responsibility of South Africa and Namibia; collaboration between these two countries is important.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Crowned Eagle Stephanoaetus coronatus meets the criterion for regionally Vulnerable under D1 (population size estimated to number less than1 000 mature individuals). In addition, the regional population is projected to undergo a continuous decline that may exceeds 10% over the next three generations, as stipulated in criterion C1. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this species falls within the region. In addition, the Crowned Eagle was assessed in 2000 as regionally Near Threatened and is currently listed as globally Near Threatened. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A monotypic species, and the only member of its genus. </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">80-90 cm; 3.6 kg. A large, powerful and attractively patterned eagle of forested, hilly landscapes. Adults can be identified by their hawk-like appearance with mostly dark colouration and obvious crest. Upperparts and crown mostly blackish with dark chestnut-brown on sides of neck and face. Below heavily barred black, with chest washed rufous. Tail grey with obvious broad, dark bars. Underwing coverts chestnut and remiges white with two (females) or three (males) black bars. Bill black with grey cere. Feet yellowish with black claws. Leggings heavily barred and spotted. Juveniles are much paler than adults, with whitish head, nape and crown. Upperparts dark grey, with prominent white feather edges. Underparts mostly white with brownish wash on breast. Bill black with grey cere. Eyes yellowish brown. Undergoes three incomplete moults over four years to attain adult plumage. (Simmons 2005f).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa where it occurs from the lowland forests of West Africa, across to Ethiopia, and southwards to South Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In southern Africa, it is restricted to Zimbabwe, central Mozambique and eastern South Africa and Swaziland, where it is strongly associated with Lowveld and escarpment forests, including riparian forest along the Limpopo and Luvuvhu rivers. While there may have been local range contractions owing to habitat destruction for commercial Pinus and Eucalyptus plantations (Simmons 2005f), afforestation of former grasslands in Limpopo and Mpumalanga have resulted in an extension of available habitat (Tarboton and Allan 1984). KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape seem to be the regional strongholds of this species. Incidental records from SABAP2 show birds ranging as far west as the Overberg, Western Cape, and Bronkhorstspruit, Gauteng, indicating possible minor westward shifts in the distribution range. The species is sparsely distributed in Swaziland with only four breeding pairs known (Monadjem et al. 2003), although it may have been overlooked in the Bulungu and Siceni mountains. The Crowned Eagle is well represented in the region's Important Bird Areas.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the Crowned Eagle has not been quantified but is thought to number in the thousands (BirdLife International 2014bb). No complete census of the regional population has been completed. Boshoff et al. (1994) estimated that there were 100 mature individuals within the borders of the old Eastern Cape Province up to the Fish River, and Quickelberge (1989) mentioned that the species was common in forested localities along the coastal strip from Port St. Johns to Mbotyi, being seen or heard on most days. Inaccessibility has led to parts of Eastern Cape being under-atlased. No estimates exist for KwaZulu-Natal. Based upon the number of pentads occupied in the province, one could estimate the population to be in the region of 400 mature individuals, although in urban areas their density can increase, e.g. there may bec. 40 mature individuals in eThekwini (Durban) Municipality alone (DG Allan pers. comm.). Likewise, up to 80 mature individuals are thought to occur within a 70 km radius of Nelspruit in Mpumalanga (GR Batchelor pers. comm.). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Parker (1994a) estimated the Swaziland population at 60 mature individuals, but Monadjem and Rasmussen (2008) reported only four nests for the country, but admitted that nests may have been overlooked in Malolotja National Park, Kobolondlo Mountain, as well as the Lubombo Hills, where pairs have been sighted. Nevertheless, it appears that the Swaziland population has undergone a significant decline. Simmons (2005f) concurred with Tarboton and Allan's (1984) estimate of 200 mature individuals in the north-east of South Africa, which included the current Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces. A conservative estimate of the regional population is set at c. 800-900 mature individuals. Confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Globally, this species is threatened by persecution through trapping, shooting and nest destruction, competition for prey from humans, and habitat loss through deforestation (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). This suite of widespread threats implies that the species is in moderately rapid decline, especially considering its slow reproductive rate. However, this decline is not currently thought to be severe, owing to the species' tolerance of modified habitats. The AoO estimates provided by SABAP2 may indicate a slight decrease in the regional population. In addition to this, it seems that there has been a decrease in the size of the Swaziland population based on the difference between estimates by Parker (1994a) and Monadjem and Rasmussen (2008). For these reasons, the population trend is assessed to be negative. The confidence in this regional population trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is found mostly in forest, including gallery and riverine forest, but also occurs in woodland and forested gorges in savannah and grassland (Simmons 2005f). Crowned Eagles are readily found in plantations of exotic trees. They normally perch for long periods, resting inside the forest canopy, but will sometimes soar high above the canopy. Males also perform repeated aerial displays accompanied by loud calls in the vicinity of the nesting territory. The diet is composed primarily of mammals (96%) and particularly hyraxes, antelope and primates; large birds (3.5%) and reptiles (0.5%) make up the remainder (Simmons 2005f). A generation length of 18.5 years, based on a published estimate of mean age at first breeding and extrapolated maximum longevity in the wild, was provided by BirdLife International (2014bb).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Crowned Eagles have been known to predate on small stock animals, chickens, dogs and domestic cats (Daneel 1979) and, recently, piglets (GR Batchelor pers. comm.), bringing the species into conflict with humans and resulting in persecution by stock farmers (Brown 1982). The loss of forest habitat has had a relatively small negative impact on the species because it has been able to adapt relatively well to nesting in alien plantations.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Crowned Eagle Working Group consists of members of the Lowveld Bird Club, which is a member of Birdlife South Africa. A core group of members attempt to monitor the breeding success of each nest annually. Activities of the group are mainly confined to the Mpumalanga Lowveld. The University of KwaZulu-Natal is undertaking research on dispersal and movements of immature birds, although this research is limited to Kwa&#173;&#173;Zulu-Natal.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There is an urgent need to protect remaining primary forest throughout the species' range. Conservation targets should be established, and regular monitoring, under the auspices of the Crowned Eagle Working Group, should determine the status of the whole regional population. An environmental education programme aimed at local communities should to be implemented. There needs to be increased engagement with stakeholders, including land-owners such as forest companies, as well as private individuals whose properties hold Crowned Eagle nests. A Species Management Plan may be appropriate.&#9;</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Verreauxs' Eagle Aquila verreauxii qualifies as regionally Vulnerable under the population-size criterion (less than10 000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be greater than 10% in three generations). In addition, the species approaches the population-trend criterion for regionally Vulnerable (an observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population size reduction of 30% over three generations where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible). </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution occurs within the region. In addition, Verreauxs' Eagle appears to have undergone a greater than 30% decline in AoO between SABAP1 and SABAP2.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">80-90 cm, 3.7-4.5 kg. An unmistakeable, large, jet-black eagle with distinctive white markings. The sexes are alike in plumage colouration, although the female is larger and heavier. The back and rump of both sexes are white with a narrow ‘V' extending from the back towards the head on either side of the mantle. The bill is grey with a yellow cere, gape and lores. The eyes are dark brown with a yellow orbital ring. In flight the wings are distinctly narrowed basally, with bulging secondaries and a prominent large pale patch at the base of the primaries (Simmons 2005g).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Verreauxs' Eagle has a wide distribution throughout Africa, stretching from Eritrea and Ethiopia in the north, southward to South Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Within the region, the species is distributed across five different biomes: Fynbos, Grassland, Savannah, Nama-Karoo and Succulent Karoo. Within these biomes, it is mainly restricted to mountainous terrain (Davies and Allan 1997) because of its hunting and breeding biology. The distribution is closely linked to the presence of Rock Hyrax Procavia capensis (Gargett and Mundy 1990). For example, in Giant's Castle Nature Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal, the amount of suitable habitat for Rock Hyrax was limited, and Verreaux's Eagles had larger home ranges (Brown 1988b). Surprisingly, it is scarce to absent in apparently suitable habitat in much of Lesotho and the former Transkei (Davies and Allan 1997). The species is restricted to the Highveld of Swaziland, with nests recorded in Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary and suspected in Malolotja National Park (Monadjem et al. 2003). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At the time of writing, the species had been recorded from 998 pentads during SABAP2. A comparison of the EoO between SABAP1 and SABAP2 shows minimal change (-2%), but a decline of 42% in AoO. The species is still well represented in the IBA network throughout the region. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified, but is thought to number in the tens of thousands (BirdLife International 2014bc). Few historical and no current regional population estimates exist. Tarboton and Allan (1984) estimated the population in north-eastern South Africa to be 500 mature individuals. Davies (1994) provides an estimate of 2 000 mature individuals for the former Cape Province. In Swaziland, Parker (1994a) estimated there to be 10 mature individuals, with Monadjem and Rasmussen (2008) providing a slightly lower estimate of eight birds. Reported densities in the region range from a low of one pair/65 km2 in the Drakensberg (Brown 1988b) to one pair/24 km2 in the Karoo (Davies and Ferguson 2000).  Allan (1988b) calculated average home ranges of 35 km2 for birds in the Magaliesberg, based on 13 pairs spaced on average 9.5 km apart, while figures calculated for suitable habitat in other areas of the former Transvaal averaged 7-13 km between pairs (Tarboton and Allan 1984). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Outside of the region, a maximum of one pair/10 km2 was recorded in the Matobos, Zimbabwe (Gargett and Mundy 1990), an area of optimal habitat. An average density of one pair/41 km2 was used to extrapolate a regional population of 3 505 mature individuals, based on the reported AoO of 71 856 km2. This estimate is possibly an underestimate for two reasons. The density estimate may be higher than reported, with the average influenced by Brown's study in the Drakensberg (Brown 1988b). In addition, large areas of Northern Cape and western portions of North West Province, where the species is up to seven times more abundant than other raptors (Boshoff et al. 1983), have not been adequately atlased. The regional population is therefore estimated to be 3 500-3 750 mature individuals. Confidence in this estimate is low and this figure requires verification.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is thought to be stable in the absence of declines or substantial threats (BirdLife International 2014bc). Within the region, Verreauxs' Eagle has apparently undergone a reduction of 42% in AoO since 1993, as well as a drop in reporting rates in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. This suggests that the species has undergone a decline in population between the two atlas reporting periods. However, the relationship between AoO as calculated for SABAP1 and SABAP2 data, and populations of large, sparsely distributed birds, has not been verified. The regional population is suspected to be undergoing a decline, although the rate is unknown and requires further investigation. While the exact rate of decline is not known it is thought to be greater than 10% over three generations. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Verreauxs' Eagle is a solitary nester that builds a massive stick structure on a rocky outcrop or cliff, or more rarely in a tree or on a power pylon. Utilisation of pylons is on the increase in the Karoo (AR Jenkins pers. comm). The species pair-bonds for a number of years, although mate changes may occur more often than recorded (AR Jenkins pers. comm). Juveniles disperse from breeding areas, while adults show a strong fidelity to their breeding territories (Gargett and Mundy 1990). Availability of prey seems to be the main determinant of timing of breeding and breeding density (Gargett and Mundy 1990). Typically, birds breed from April with a single nestling fledging in October/November (Davies and Allan 1997). A generation length of 17.3 years is the mean of two calculated values derived from published and/or extrapolated estimates of mean age at first breeding, maximum longevity in the wild and mean annual adult survival (BirdLife International 2014bc).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This eagle feeds mainly on Rock Hyrax Procavia capensis although, in common with other raptors, it is an opportunistic predator that will also take medium-sized mammals, large birds and carrion (Simmons 2005g). Predation of hyrax varied from 70 to 180 hyraxes per pair per year and has been estimated to exceed 350 elsewhere (Gargett and Mundy 1990, Davies 1999). Paradoxically, the breeding performance of Verreauxs' Eagle shows an inverse relationship with rainfall (Allan 1988), as more hyraxes become available to eagles when they are forced to move further from their refuges to find food during drought (Davies 1994). Populations do not show good correlation with fluctuations in hyrax numbers (Davies and Ferguson 2000), because the eagles are able to switch to alternative prey items when hyraxes are scarce. Birds in the Strandveld on the West Coast rely heavily on Angulate Tortoise Chersina angulata and Molerats Cryptomus and Bathyergus spp. (M Murgatroyd unpubl. data). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat faced by the species within the region is pressure from stock farmers (Davies 1994). Direct persecution by farmers is usually in retaliation to these eagles catching domestic livestock and poultry, or fouling drinking water (Anderson 2000a). Ironically, the beneficial role that a pair of Verreauxs' Eagles play on a farm, in terms of controlling hyrax numbers and distribution, outweighs the cost of occasional lamb predation by a factor of 155 times (Davies and Ferguson 2000). Fortunately, the species' low reliance on carrion, in contrast to the habits of Tawny Eagle Aquila rapax and Bateleur Terathopius ecaudatus, reduces the risk from poisoning events (Davies and Allan 1997). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Incidents of Verreauxs' Eagle being caught and killed/maimed in gin traps in Northern Cape have been reported (Anderson 2000a). The depletion of the primary prey species, Rock Hyrax, through hunting is likely to have a negative impact on breeding success (Monadjem et al. 2003) and has been identified by several authors as a reason for localised declines (Osborne and Tigar 1990, Chiweshe 2007). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Anderson at al. (1999) reported that Verreauxs' Eagle is one of the four raptors most likely to drown in reservoirs. Urbanisation is a threat, particularly if it results in a decrease in the prey base. Allan (1984), in his study of Verreauxs' Eagle in the Magaliesberg, reported that most breeding failures were human-induced. The species is somewhat susceptible to collisions with and resultant electrocution from power-lines and related infrastructure. Development of wind farms, especially in mountainous areas, poses a future threat to this species, which may prove to be highly significant.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two projects, run under the auspices of Endangered Wildlife Trust's Birds of Prey Working Group, assist with conservation of Verreauxs' Eagle. The Western Cape Black Eagle Project focuses on aspects of the biology of Verreauxs' Eagles in Table Mountain National Park, the eastern False Bay Mountains and the western edge of Clanwilliam, the Nuweveldberge of Karoo National Park and the Cederberg. The Kalahari Raptor Project facilitates the monitoring and conservation of all raptors in the Kalahari region of South Africa, with a focus on Kgalagadi TFCA and adjacent areas. A separate project in Western Cape, the Black Eagle Project, operates under the auspices of the Cape Leopard Trust and Animal Demography Unit. The species is listed as regionally Near Threatened in Namibia (Simmons et al. 2015) and regionally Vulnerable in Swaziland (Monadjem et al. 2003). It is protected in Northern Cape under the Cape Province Nature and Environmental Conservation Ordinance; No. 19 of 1974, as well as the Swaziland Game Act, No. 51 of 1953 (Monadjem et al. 2003).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The main threat to Verreauxs' Eagle is persecution by stock farmers. The success of awareness programmes should be investigated, and if necessary, improvements made. Proactive installation of anti-electrocution, bird-friendly power-line structures should continue. Simple measures to prevent drownings in reservoirs include attaching a floating log to the side of the reservoir, placing a cover over reservoirs, and keeping reservoirs full (Anderson et al. 1999)</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Lanner Falcon Falco biarmicus appears to be decreasing at a rate that satisfies the population-trend criterion for regionally Vulnerable (greater than 30% decline over 10 years or three generations). In addition, the species qualifies for regionally Vulnerable under the population-size criterion (less than10 000 mature individuals, with a continuing decline estimated to be greater than 10% over three generations). </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global population occurs within the region. The species was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lanner Falcon has five subspecies, namely F. b. biarmicus (southern Africa), F. b. abyssinicus (western, central and eastern Africa), F. b. tanypterus (northern Africa and Israel), F. b. erlangeri (north-west Africa) and F. b. feldeggi (southern Italy and eastward to Azerbaijan) (Wink et al. 2004).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">36-48 cm, 490-690 g. A large, powerful falcon, which is distinguished by its rufous crown and nape and small black cap that extends past the eyes to form narrow malar stripes. Sexes alike in plumage colouration, but females larger. Upperparts brownish to slate grey. Underparts creamy beige with limited fine streaking and light spotting. Bill grey with dark tip and yellow cere. Legs and feet yellow; claws black. Juvenile differs in having a pale brown crown and nape and heavy streaking on the underparts, and a blue-grey cere and orbital ring (Jenkins 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lanner Falcon is widespread across Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Western Palearctic (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Within the region, the species occurs widely but sparsely throughout South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, with the highest densities recorded in Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The species is a partial seasonal migrant, and there is a post-breeding exodus from the core breeding range in the eastern sour grasslands (December-January), with apparent movements westwards in the non-breeding season into Fynbos, Nama Karoo and southern Kalahari, returning May-June (van Zyl et al. 1994). Movements may be more variable and nomadic in character, and are probably related to rainfall and consequently prey abundance. The species has been able to take advantage of existing corvid nests on transmission poles in the Karoo, enabling it to inhabit large expanses of otherwise treeless habitat (Jenkins 2000b). Comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 data between 1997 and 2015 indicates that the species has undergone a c. 40% decline in AoO. While the relationship between a decline in AoO and sparsely distributed species has not been verified it does indicate that the Lanner Falcon may have undergone a decline. The species is well represented in the regional Important Bird Areas network.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014bd) although Ferguson-Lees and Christie (2001) estimated at least 65 000 pairs. Cade and Digby (1982) estimated that 9 000-18 000 pairs occur in the region, while Tarboton and Allan (1984) estimated 1 400 pairs in the former Transvaal. These population estimates are now almost certainly out of date and overly optimistic. Barnes and Jenkins (2000) did not provide a population estimate in their 2000 assessment of the species. A preliminary estimate of less than5 000 mature individuals in the region is provided here, although confidence in this figure is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has suffered local declines (BirdLife International 2014bd). Between 1997 and 2013, the species has apparently undergone a considerable (c. 40%) decline in AoO. As Lanner Falcons are territorial and relatively conspicuous, the species is unlikely to have been under-recorded in SABAP2. Assuming that the population in 1997, three generations ago, was in the region of 13 500 mature individuals, and that the decline was exponential, this would represent a decrease of 45% over three generations. This is a conservative estimate and is based upon the assumption that the population was stable between 1982 and 1997; this is unlikely to have been the case, particularly in agricultural landscapes (Kemp 1993). Confidence in the estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Lanner Falcons favour open grassland, cleared woodlands and agricultural areas. Breeding pairs tend to favour cliffs as nesting and roosting sites; however, they will use alternative structures such as trees, pylons and buildings. The dominant prey group is birds, followed by small mammals, reptiles and insects (Jenkins and Avery 1999). A generation length of 6.9 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014bd).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to the Lanner Falcon is the loss or transformation of habitat within the Grassland Biome, through urbanisation, agriculture and afforestation, with corresponding reductions in preferred prey and foraging opportunities (Barnes and Jenkins 2000). To some extent, these processes may be offset in woodland and forested areas where the clearing of trees serves to enhance existing conditions or even create additional habitat. Secondary threats include poisoning by agrochemicals (Kemp 1993), collisions with power-lines, and persecution by pigeon fanciers and owners of domestic fowl (which in some areas make up 30-40% of their diet; Leonardi et al. 1992).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific actions are currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Conservation measures must focus on identifying and legally protecting key sites and preserving suitable habitat, as well as the promotion of policies for reduction in use of pesticides. A Species Action Plan is recommended. Options for minimising motivation for direct persecution by poultry farmers and pigeon owners should be investigated.</p>

	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the species' global range occurs within the region. In addition, it was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Four subspecies are recognised in the Afrotropical range of the African Finfoot, with the subspecies P. s. petersii occurring in southern Africa.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">45-65 cm. A medium-sized, cormorant- or grebe-like aquatic bird, with an elongated body, long neck, dagger-like bill and lobed feet with strong claws, set far back on body. Both sexes have 4 mm long carpal claws. Sexes differ in plumage and size. Male has crown and back of neck black with greenish gloss. Mantle dark brown, each feather with whitish sub-terminal spot. Rump and uppertail coverts rufescent brown with small white spots. Lores, throat and foreneck grey, flecked with white. Breast and flanks coarsely barred or streaked. Belly creamy white. Conspicuous white stripe from behind eye down side of neck. Wing dark brown; coverts with creamy spots. Tail blackish and stiff, with amber shafts. Bill coral red. Eyes reddish brown. Legs and feet red-orange, with yellow nails; toes broadly lobed. Non-breeding male has a whiter throat. Adult female similar but neck brown, throat white, ear coverts and stripe down side of neck dark greyish, bordered above by a white line. Bill reddish, upper mandible and tip dusky. Eyes pale reddish brown. Juvenile similar to female but warmer brown above with less distinct white spots (Urban et al. 1986).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Finfoot occurs throughout central and western Africa, although it is absent from the drier North and East African regions. In southern Africa, it occurs from the eastern Caprivi in Namibia through most of Zimbabwe, where it is localised but widespread. It is largely absent from Okavango Delta in Botswana, possibly due to the static nature of water-flow there, the nutrient-poor nature of the system and the fact that tree cover is usually far from the floodplain (Chittenden 2005d). It is rare in central and southern Mozambique (Parker 1999, Chittenden 2005d). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Within the region, the African Finfoot is distributed throughout low-lying parts of northern and eastern South Africa and Swaziland, and along the coast. It is perhaps most common on large, east-flowing rivers of the Lowveld, including the Luvuvhu, lower Olifants, Letaba, Sabie, (eastern) Crocodile and Komati rivers. It is localised and less numerous in the interior, occurring on the upper Olifants, Pienaar's, (western) Crocodile, Hennops, Magalies, Skeerpoort and Palala-Limpopo rivers (Tarboton et al. 1987). In addition, it was recorded along the Mogalakwena, Marico and Wilge rivers during SABAP2. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Despite earlier records from the Vaal and Renoster rivers and Vredespruit in Free State (Colahan et al. 1995), it was not recorded there during SABAP2. The species is relatively numerous in Zululand in northern KwaZulu-Natal and along wooded drainages in coastal KwaZulu-Natal. It was recorded in scattered locations in Eastern Cape, with a concentration of records around East London. The westernmost record was from the vicinity of Mossel Bay in Western Cape.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In contrast with the small change in EoO shown for this species, the SABAP2 data indicate that it has undergone a marked decrease in AoO. During SABAP2, it was recorded in 80 quarter degree grid cells (at the time of writing), which suggests a maximum range of 56 000 km2. However, Barnes and Parker (2000b) estimated that less than1% of the surface area of the grid cells in which this species occurs represents its highly localised and specialised riverine habitat; accordingly, a modified estimate suggests that its AoO is less than560 km2, representing a c. 22% decrease in AoO. However, the African Finfoot is secretive, quiet and inconspicuous, and thus easily overlooked, and may be more numerous than current atlas records indicate (Tarboton et al. 1987).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014be). The African Finfoot is highly localised due to its specialised habitat requirements, and is nowhere common. The total regional population was estimated at 500-1 000 birds (Barnes and Parker 2000b), of which 10-20% occur in Kruger National Park. Smaller populations are resident in scattered localities, although isolated records may represent vagrants or dispersing birds, as this species is known to colonise new areas rapidly (Chittenden 2005d). The population in Swaziland was estimated at 20 breeding pairs or c. 40 birds (Parker 1994). The species is rare in adjacent southern Mozambique, where its population is estimated at less than100 birds (Parker 1999). The current regional population is less than1 000 mature individuals. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Because of its highly specialised habitat requirements, the African Finfoot is a naturally rare and localised species. A modified estimate of its effective AoO, taking into account the finfoot's strict ecological preferences, suggests that its current regional range is very limited (less than560 km2). In addition, the range appears to have decreased by c. 22% in the last 2-3 decades since SABAP1 surveys commenced. The regional population is therefore thought to be declining, based on reductions in range and continued threats to its sensitive habitat. The rate of this decline is not known, but is likely to be at least 10% within the next three generations. Confidence in this estimate is medium. Similar decreases are detectable in other riverine specialists that co-occur with the African Finfoot, such as White-backed Night Heron Gorsachius leuconotus, Pel's Fishing Owl Scotopelia peli, and Half-collared Kingfisher Alcedo semitorquata. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Occurs singly or in pairs on clear, perennial rivers and streams lined by thick riparian bush and with overhanging trees, shrubbery and reeds (Urban et al. 1986, Barnes and Parker 2000b). Avoids both stagnant and fast-flowing turbulent waters, and prefers perennial to ephemeral watercourses, and clear to silted water. Generally keeps to secluded, shady areas and seldom found far from shoreline vegetation; occasionally in mangroves, at edges of dense papyrus beds, and along vegetated verges of dams (Urban et al. 1986). Water temperature might be an important factor, as finfoots' plumage is probably not waterproof (Allan 1997b). Finfoots hunt aquatic invertebrates and small vertebrates while swimming or walking along riverbanks, and roost at night in riverine vegetation or on branches overhanging water. Then nest is built in tangles of flood debris caught among branches overhanging water or among driftwood or reeds (Tarboton 2011).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Finfoot is threatened primarily by a reduction of water flow through commercial afforestation of catchment areas, damming and water extraction, as well as degradation and clearing of riverine vegetation, and increased salt and silt loads in rivers because of erosion (Barnes and Parker 2000b). In addition, pesticide contamination may lead to primary poisoning, secondary poisoning through eating affected prey, and reductions in prey availability. Increased human settlement, cultivation along rivers and the acute water shortages facing South Africa suggest that this species' woes are set to continue for the foreseeable future. Locally, its sensitive habitat may be degraded through trampling and damaging by both domestic livestock and wild game, particularly African Elephants Loxodonta africana. The species is hunted and traded in the traditional medicine industry elsewhere in its range, but whether this is a significant threat in the region is unknown and should be investigated.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific measures are currently underway, but the African Finfoot occurs in several large conservation areas where it is adequately protected. However, external factors such as soil erosion in river catchments, damming and excessive water abstraction upstream and outside of conservation areas, are still likely to impact negatively upon this species.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES Proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Long-term survival of the African Finfoot and other aquatic and riverine species will ultimately depend on effective management of rivers and riverine vegetation at the ecosystem-level through national, provincial and municipal initiatives. Particular attention should be paid to protection of riverine vegetation, and measures to reduce siltation and excessive abstraction, and reduce human disturbance, would benefit this species (Barnes and Parker 2000b). In the short-term, the species is probably dependent on existing protected areas. A full census of suitable river systems should be conducted to modify current population estimates, determine linear densities and investigate exact habitat requirements; such efforts could simultaneously contribute to research on other co-occurring riverine specialists.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Striped Flufftail Sarothrura affinis is suspected to be undergoing a decline as a result of habitat loss, such that 10% of the regional population may have been lost in the last three generations, qualifying the species as regionally Vulnerable. Throughout its fragmented range, suitable grassland habitat is under severe threat from unsuitable burning regimes, heavy grazing, agriculture and afforestation.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two races have been described, the nominate being endemic to South Africa and Swaziland, and S. a. antonii occurring from Zimbabwe northwards. However, the latter may include two further undescribed taxa, from the Kenyan Highlands east and west of the Rift Valley, respectively (Keith et al. 1970, Taylor and Van Perlo 1998). The species was previously known as Sarothrura lineata.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">14-15 cm, 25-30 g. A small and exceptionally secretive terrestrial rallid that would be entirely overlooked if not for its carrying and distinctive vocalisations. Sexes differ in plumage colouration. Male with chestnut crown, face and nape, contrasting with white chin and throat. Rest of body, tertials and upperwing coverts dark blackish brown with narrow white streaks. Upper- and undertail coverts and tail chestnut. Remiges dark greyish-brown, outermost primary with white outer web. Female generally browner with dark blackish-brown upperparts, sides of head and neck tinged light chestnut or rufous. Heavily barred and scalloped off-white to rich buff above. Chin and throat white, and remainder of underparts buff to white, spotted and scaled dark brown, becoming barred on flanks; undertail coverts rusty brown, barred blackish-brown. Tail chestnut, barred black. In both sexes bill dark, variably paler on base of lower mandible, eyes dark, and legs and feet pinkish brown to pinkish grey. Juvenile uniform dull greyish black above and greyish brown below (Taylor and Van Perlo 1998, Hockey 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In its extensive but fragmented Afrotropical range, the Striped Flufftail occurs in six isolated relict populations in montane grassland habitats. The race antonii occurs from South Sudan to the highlands of western and central Kenya and the Kenya-Tanzania border, as well as in southern Tanzania, Malawi and adjacent Zambia, and at three localities in the highlands of eastern Zimbabwe (Irwin 1981, Taylor 1994). There are no records from adjacent Mozambique (Parker 1999). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The nominate race is endemic to South Africa, Swaziland and, at least formerly, Lesotho. In South Africa, this taxon occurs from the Cape Peninsula eastwards along mountain ranges in Western Cape, at scattered localities throughout Eastern Cape (although it is uncommon to rare in the former Transkei; Quickelberge 1989) to southern KwaZulu-Natal and the Drakensberg. It is also known from south-eastern Mpumalanga (Kaapschehoop, Belfast, Graskop areas) and adjacent Swaziland, where it is apparently restricted to Malolotja National Park (Parker 1994). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In Limpopo Province, there are few records, although Allan (1988c) mentions its occurrence at Serala (Wolkberg), and a specimen was collected at Woodbush in 1905 (Tarboton et al. 1987); the species does still persist in that area, as evidenced by a December 2014 photographic record from the Haenertsburg area (D. Vasapolli pers. comm.). The northern population was previously thought to be isolated from populations in KwaZulu-Natal, but a 1907 specimen from Zuurbron, east of Wakkerstroom, Mpumalanga (Taylor 1994), and recent records from the eastern Free State (Botha 1997, 1999) suggest that the range may be more continuous than previously thought (Hockey 2005a). A record from Teyateyaneng, Lesotho was rejected by Winterbottom (Bonde 1993), but is probably acceptable, and the species may still occur in that country (Taylor 1994). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">By combining the surface areas of all sites known to support this species, Taylor (2000c) estimated the total area of occupancy at 24 500 km2, but cautioned that this an overestimate as only a fraction of this area holds suitable habitat, and that a revised total AoO of 2 400 km2 is more appropriate. Although a comparison of the SABAP1 and SABAP2 data sets suggests a decrease of c. 10% in the regional AoO, this estimate is probably still valid. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size is unknown. Striped Flufftails are generally considered uncommon to rare, but are certainly widely overlooked due to their extremely secretive and elusive nature (Graham and Ryan 1984, Tarboton et al. 1987). Quantitative surveys by experienced observers may reveal that the species is more numerous and widespread than currently thought (Taylor 2000d). Surveys are best conducted during the summer breeding season, when males often sing throughout the night (with the hooting call audible at up to 2 km on a still night). Both sexes also frequently give piercing territorial calls during the day (Taylor 1994). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species can occur at high local densities in well-managed protected areas. For example at one study site (Mount Currie Nature Reserve IBA SA084), 59 territories were located, of which 16-33 were occupied in a season; the maximum breeding population for the reserve was 33 pairs in one summer, occurring at a density of 1 pair/21 ha of suitable habitat, and a maximum of 1 pair/11 ha (Taylor 1994, 2000c). Territories are 1.05-2.30 ha (1.64 ± 0.36 ha) in extent, while home ranges are 2.00-3.24 ha (2.58 ± 0.38 ha) in size. It has recently been recorded at a number of new localities in Western Cape (Graham and Ryan 1984, Ryan 1987b, Taylor 2000d) and is described as fairly common in some areas of that province (Hockey 1989). Barnes (1998a) estimated the regional population occurring in IBAs at 466-618 breeding pairs or 1 203-1 895 birds. Additional populations from non-IBA sites (Taylor 1997a) raises this total to 586-738 breeding pairs or 1 443-2 135 birds. Recent population estimates are unavailable, but it is unlikely that these figures have changed significantly. The regional population is thus estimated at c. 1 730 (range 1 440-2 150) mature individuals (Taylor 2000d). Confidence in this estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is decreasing (BirdLife International 2014bf). The regional population is also suspected to be undergoing a decline owing to ongoing habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation (Taylor 2000d), but the extent and rate of this decline are unknown.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Extensively studied by Taylor (1994). Inhabits a variety of dense vegetation types that offer concealment but open ground below for foraging. In summer-rainfall regions, generally inhabits open upland sourveld grassland dominated by Themeda triandra grass, with other grasses including Hyparrhenia, Festuca, Tristachya and Cymbopogon, with or without woody elements such as Protea, Leucosidea and Buddleja, as well as bracken-briar thickets, patches of tall forbs, and grassy cover near forest fringes. In KwaZulu-Natal, optimal grassland is 0.35-1.0 m tall, with mean vegetation height =60 cm in 88% of territories. Prefers areas with mean ground cover of 80-100%. Avoids sites on very steep slopes, or with ground cover of greater than 8% rocks, except where these are screened by overhanging vegetation; most territories are located on slopes of 4-26°, with the majority on concave slopes (rarely on flat ground or convex slopes that have poorer soils, more rocks, shorter grass, more exposure and lack drainage lines). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Most territories in KwaZulu-Natal include a drainage line, and the species is often associated with small seepage zones or marshy areas, but apart from temporarily displaced or newly arrived individuals it does not occur regularly in larger wetlands, where it is replaced by Red-chested Flufftail S. rufa. Very uncommon in farming areas, but occasionally occurs in croplands such as lucerne or millet, especially if such fields are near moist depressions. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In Western Cape found in dense Psoralea-Osmitopsis Fynbos, usually next to streams or near moist depressions (Graham and Ryan 1984, Ryan 1987b, Kakebeeke 1993); one nest was located in a dry patch of Pycreus and Juncus surrounded by taller Mariscus sedges on marshy ground occupied by Red-chested Flufftails. Also reported from dense restioid thickets. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Occurs from 250 m to 2 100 m in KwaZulu-Natal, and up to 2 500 m in Zimbabwe; upper altitudinal limits unknown in the Fynbos Biome. Extent of movements imperfectly known, but probably altitudinal and possibly over distances as small as 35-40 km, to areas below 1 000- 1 200 m (Taylor and Van Perlo 1998). However, there is no detectable parallel influx into lower-lying coastal areas in winter. Sedentary at lower altitudes where vegetation cover and invertebrate food remains suitable throughout the year, but a breeding visitor to upland sites in KwaZulu-Natal, where it arrives in October to January and departs in April to June with decreases in temperatures and invertebrates. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Timing of return to burnt areas depends on vegetation regrowth and recovery rate of invertebrate populations, and birds do not return if conditions are not suitable by January, as this will not allow sufficient time to breed. More territories are located in sites that were not burned during the previous dry season, and earliest-arriving males occupy unburned grassland. In KwaZulu-Natal males start hooting immediately upon arrival in November to January, with calling frequency decreasing after 1-4 weeks when territories have been established and breeding has commenced, and calling ceasing after late February. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Resident year-round in some areas of Western Cape, but probably undergoes local movements in response to fires. All breeding records fall between September and March, seemingly peaking in December to February in summer-rainfall regions and September in the Western Cape. Monogamous and territorial during the breeding season, but may congregate in small groups in lower-altitude habitats after breeding. </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As with other threatened grassland species, the main threat to the Striped Flufftail is the continued degradation and loss of its upland grassland habitat through unsuitable burning practices, intensive grazing, agricultural practices and commercial afforestation (Taylor 2000d). Particularly in coastal areas, urban settlement has also destroyed much former habitat. Although the species remains relatively numerous in a few well-managed protected areas, its range has become more fragmented and it has disappeared from many regions. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Inappropriate fire regimes, including fast-moving and/or high-intensity fires, are likely to cause local population decreases. The species appears to be adapted to both fire climax and post-fire climax vegetation, occurring in both short pure grassland and longer grass associated with scrub and forest edges. In KwaZulu-Natal, burns immediately reduce the breeding density, but the breeding population increases during the second season after a burn (Taylor 1994); periodic burning (or grazing) is thus necessary to maintain optimal habitat. Habitats not burned for 3-4 years develop a dense layer of moribund ground cover, only becoming suitable for occupation by flufftails again after several years when grass tufts become taller and less impenetrable. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Likewise, although a relatively high proportion of Mountain Fynbos is under formal conservation, inappropriate fire frequency and intensity is also considered a threat to this species in the Fynbos Biome. Very rapidly-moving and intense fires, especially in moribund vegetation, also pose a direct mortality risk, and there is one anecdotal account of a bird that died due to injuries sustained during a fire. It appears that the reluctance of flufftails to fly to escape fires may be fatal, e.g. Red-chested Flufftails have been recorded running ahead of fires for long distances instead of flushing; when they eventually emerged onto a road they appeared dazed and confused by the smoke and could be caught by hand (or waiting natural predators such as Black-headed Herons Ardea melanocephala). Flufftails have also been recorded hiding inside dense tussocks of rushes to escape fires, or even enter rodent burrows (Taylor 1994). Slower and cooler burns tend to burn more patchily, leaving unburned spots that are probably important refuges for flufftails and other species.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> The potential effects of climate change on this species have not been fully investigated, but may constitute a considerable cause for concern, given the Striped Flufftail's mountain habitats and occurrence in the Fynbos Biome (Simmons et al. 2004). Severe weather conditions also pose a local threat. Being highly sought-after by birdwatchers, avitourism may pose a limited local threat through disturbance, excessive playback of calls and trampling at popular birding sites. There are records of predation by Domestic cats Felis catus, and Lanner Falcon Falco biarmicus, while Black Harrier Circus maurus and Slender Mongoose Herpestes sanguinea are apparently attracted to Striped Flufftail vocalisations (Taylor 1994). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures are currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Taylor (1994) summarised suggested conservation priorities, and identified key conservation areas, particularly the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park (IBA SA064) which holds 68% of the region's known breeding pairs. Although accurate population estimates have not been calculated for many reserves, the future of this species and its upland grassland habitat is relatively secure in formally conserved upland grassland. However, the wintering areas may lie at lower elevations outside such protected areas, and habitat loss at these lower altitude sites could contribute to regional population declines, even if the breeding habitat is managed correctly. Notwithstanding the considerable difficulties in such a task, a priority should be an investigation of the extent of seasonal movements, the identification of significant wintering areas, and the effective management of such sites (Taylor 2000d). A good first step would be to survey suitable habitat in the mildest climatic conditions at low elevations within the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park (Taylor 1994). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In farming areas suitable habitat patches could be created by encouraging land-owners to practise less intensive and continuous grazing, adoption of a biennial burning cycle and leaving some areas ungrazed for 1-2 years (Taylor 1994). Even a patch as small as 1.5-2 ha (e.g. on stream valley slopes or near moist depressions, in bracken-briar stands, or Leucosidea/Buddleja patches), will create suitable habitat and have a minimal effect on a farm's grazing potential (Taylor 2000d). In terms of burning frequency, the best strategy is to mimic natural burns by establishing a mosaic of burned and unburned patches, thereby promoting growth of fire climax grassland on a biennial cycle, and establishment of post-fire climax areas of rank tall grass and scrub (Taylor 1994).</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional breeding population of Cape Gannet Morus capensis, although numbering 240 000 mature individuals, is confined to only three colonies in South Africa, which are vulnerable to catastrophic events. In light of this, the species satisfies the criterion for Vulnerable under D2 (population with a very restricted Area of Occupancy (less than20 km2) or number of locations (less than5) such that it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short period). </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this species as well as 50% of global breeding colonies are found in the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">84-94 cm, 2.6 kg. A handsome plunge-diving seabird often seen flying just offshore. Sexes alike. Adults are mostly white with black wing and tail feathers. Blue eyes surrounded by black skin. Bill grey, neatly fringed with black skin which extends down the front of the neck to form a long gular stripe. Head washed yellow, fading to white on neck. Feet dark grey with green/yellow lines along tarsal joints. Juvenile mottled brown with white spots and brown eyes; attains white plumage over about three years (Crawford 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Cape Gannets are endemic to Namibia and South Africa, where they breed on just on six islands, three of which (Mercury, Ichaboe and Possession islands) are in Namibia and the remaining three (Bird Island, Lambert's Bay; Malgas Island, Saldanha Bay; and Bird Island, Algoa Bay) in South Africa (Crawford et al. 1983). The AoO of 30.3 ha is the total area of the three South African breeding islands combined.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population has undergone fluctuations but overall has increased from 100 000 mature individuals in 1956/57 to 270 000 mature individuals in 2005/2006 (Crawford et al. 2007a). By 2011, the population had dropped to 242 000 mature individuals (Crawford et al. 2012a). The Lambert's Bay colony was abandoned in 2005 due to predation by Cape Fur Seals Arctocephalus pusillus (Crawford et al. 2007a) but has since been recolonised and in 2011 contained about 18 000 mature individuals. The Malgas Island colony has fluctuated but generally followed a downward trend and now hosts 60 000 mature individuals, while the Bird Island colony has increased and now holds 166 000 mature individuals (Crawford et al. 2012a). The total regional population is estimated at 242 000 mature individuals. The confidence in this estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional breeding population declined by 1.14% per year over the 49 years between 1956-1957 and 2005-2006 (Kemper et al. 2007), equivalent to c. 47% over 60.6 years (three 20.2-year generations). The confidence in this population trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ranges widely over the continental shelf while foraging for small pelagic fish (mainly sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus); can travel 130 km from colony, covering over 400 km in a single foraging trip (Pichegru et al. 2010b). Out of the breeding season, they can travel widely but usually stay within 500-600 km of their breeding colony; in winter, many follow sardine shoals into KwaZulu-Natal waters (Crawford et al. 1983). Immatures are more mobile and many travel up the West Coast as far as Angola (Crawford 2005b). Gannets nest in large colonies on flat or gently sloping coastal islands (Staverees et al. 2008), laying a single egg between September and December (year-round, peaking September to April at Bird Island, Algoa Bay).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Cape Gannets are vulnerable to changes in their prey distribution and have been affected by the shift in fish distributions (Roy et al. 2007); the majority of chick mortalities at breeding islands is attributable to starvation. Gannets switch to feeding on fishery discards when pelagic fish are not available (Pichegru et al. 2010b). However, a diet of fishery discards decreases chick growth and survival rates (Batchelor and Ross 1984). Gannets are also affected by oil spills (Altwegg et al. 2008, Wolfaardt et al. 2009) as well as by chronic oiling (Parsons and Underhill 2005). Seal predation is a major threat at Malgas and Bird (Lambert's Bay) Islands with seals being known to take between 29% and 83% of fledglings (Makhado et al. 2006). Seal attacks caused the temporary abandonment of the Lambert's Bay colony in 2005/2006 (Crawford et al. 2007a). Chick predation by Great White Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus is an increasing threat at Malgas Island (de Ponte Machado 2007). Gannets are also subject to accidental mortality as bycatch in the trawl (Watkins et al. 2008) and longline fishery industries. Heavy storms may reduce breeding success or destroy colonies.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">All breeding colonies enjoy some degree of protection (Lambert's Bay and Bird Island are nature reserves while Malgas Island is part of West Coast National Park) and have been declared Important Bird Areas (Barnes 1998). Rehabilitation centres such as SANCCOB in Cape Town and SAMREC in Port Elizabeth successfully rehabilitate oiled or otherwise incapacitated birds. The Department of Environmental Affairs conducts monitoring of the population size. The issue of bycatch in the trawl and longline fisheries is being addressed using bird scaring lines, line weighting and night setting. The species is protected under Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Publication of Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries 2008. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The prevention of oil pollution by increasing controls over the cleaning of ship's tanks is an important measure. The maintenance of seabird rehabilitation centres is essential.</p>

<div id="_idContainer786" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the exquisite African Pygmy Goose Nettapus auritus is suspected to be in decline and surpassing the 30% threshold for qualification as regionally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Pygmy Goose was assessed as Near Threatened in 2000. In addition, it has undergone a decline of greater than 30% between the two atlas periods. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">33 cm, 260 g. Sexes differ in plumage. A tiny, colourful duck of tropical areas. Forehead, face and neck white with brilliant green patches on sides of head. Crown and upperparts dark metallic green. Upper breast, sides and flanks chestnut; central breast and belly whitish. Tail black. Bill bright yellow. Eyes dark brown. Legs and feet grey. Female is duller than male, lacking black-bordered neck patches (Colahan 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Pygmy Goose has a wide albeit fragmented distribution across sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar (Scott and Rose 1996). Within southern Africa it occurs in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana where the Okavango Delta forms the regional stronghold (Maclean 1997b). In Zimbabwe the species occurs on the larger pan systems but is absent from the Zambezi Valley (Irwin 1981). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Within the region it is an uncommon visitor to eastern Swaziland (Parker 1994) although it is relatively common in neighbouring southern Mozambique (Cizek 2008). It is uncommon in north-eastern South Africa with the only permanent populations (given sufficient rainfall) occurring on the Nyl River Floodplain and in Kruger National Park. It is more numerous in KwaZulu-Natal, and can be locally common in the extensive wetland, floodplain and pan systems of Maputaland. In some subtropical areas pygmy geese are mainly sedentary, but elsewhere they are subject to dispersive movements dictated by habitat and water availability during the dry season (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The regional EoO has decreased only slightly since SABAP1 (now 383 681 km2) but the regional AoO has decreased by an alarming 47% to only 23 240 km2. Furthermore, only c. 2% of the reported AoO constitutes suitable habitat, meaning that a regional AoO of just 479 km2 is more realistic. The species occurs regularly in 12 IBAs, with sites such as with Kruger National Park (SA002), the Kosi Bay System (SA053), Mkuze Game Reserve (SA057) and iSimangaliso Wetland Park (SA058) being exceptionally important. Additional sites where large numbers have been recorded include Lake Mfutululu, Banzi Pan and Thulazihleka Pan in KwaZulu-Natal (Taylor 1999).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Unfortunately Barnes (2000i) does not provide an estimate of the regional population although Carboneras and Kirwan (2014) make mention that flocks of c. 1 000 birds were recorded in northern Zululand during the dry season. The regional population in all likelihood fluctuates greatly in response to rainfall and the availaibility of pans in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal. The regional population is in all likelihood less than2 500 mature individuals; the confidence in this regional population estimate is low and requires verification.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Although some populations have unknown trends, the overall global population is decreasing (Dodman and Diagana 2006). The African Pygmy Goose is a distinctive and fairly conspicuous species and the c. 47% decline in AoO between reporting periods is a reasonable indication of a concomitant decline in the regional population over a three-generation period. The confidence in this estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Pygmy Goose prefers clear, still inland waters, whether permanent or seasonal, with plentiful emergent and surface vegetation (Maclean 1997b). It is unlikely to be found in completely open waters or coastal lagoons (Maclean 1997b). The species is monogamous (Tarboton 2001), breeding October-May (Irwin 1981). Nests are made in tree holes, preferentially in trees either in standing water or close to it, but also in dense vegetation such as papyrus and old Hamerkop Scopus umbretta nests (Tarboton 2001, Kear 2005) and occasionally on thatched roofs, palm crowns or crevices in cliffs (Safford and Hawkins 2013). The species is primarily herbivorous. A generation length of 7 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014bg).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The threats facing African Pygmy Geese are not dissimilar to those relevant to Lesser Jacanas Microparra capensis, which have similar habitat requirements. Major threats include wetland degradation and destruction and interference with floodplain ecology, particularly through impoundments such as Pongolapoort Dam. Siltation of rivers is of concern (Macdonald and Birkenstock 1980). Climate change may constitute the largest threat, with parts of north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal experiencing a decline in rainfall of greater than 50% over a fifteen year period, which has an adverse effect on habitat availability. Invasive alien species such as water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes may decrease the amount of available habitat (Dowsett-Lemaire and Dowsett 2006). Kear (2005) speculated that predation by snakes may limit dry-land nesting; however, natural predation must be seen as a lesser threat.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no species-specific measures in place. The establishment of the 332 000 ha iSimangaliso Wetland Park in 1999 and, in particular, the removal of plantations from both the Western Shores and Eastern Shores sections of the park, has probably greatly benefited this species. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The conservation of the African Pygmy Goose in the region depends chiefly on the protection of wetlands, floodplain systems and pans in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal and the species should be included in future conservation planning initiatives. Control of invasive alien plant species would be beneficial. A practical measure would be to provide suitable nest boxes to encourage breeding at some wetland sites.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Disturbance and destruction of riverine vegetation, and degradation of river systems, has occurred throughout the White-backed Night Heron's range outside of protected areas, and the species may have undergone a decline in area of occupancy of 30% in the last three generations, qualifying it as Vulnerable. The regional population is estimated to be less than1 000 mature individuals, occupying a highly fragmented range of less than400 km2. Because the species is inconspicuous and nocturnal, declines could easily go unnoticed. Acute water shortages facing South Africa suggest that water abstraction, detrimental changes in hydrology, and degradation of riverine habitats are set to continue, as is a decline in water quality due to increasing turbidity, siltation, erosion, and pollution.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The generic position of the White-backed Night Heron is debated; the species is frequently placed in the genus Calherodius (del Hoyo et al. 1992, BirdLife International 2014bh), while osteological morphology may suggest a close relationship with Nyctanassa (Payne and Risley 1976). Tarsal morphology and some plumage characters agree with Nycticorax (Payne and Risley 1976), but Gorsachius differs from the latter in having the juvenile plumage more similar to the adult's, and nesting singly as opposed to colonially (Bock 1956). It is here retained in Gorsachius, following Brown et al. (1982), Allan (2005e) and Gill and Donsker (2015). Often considered monotypic, but some authorities separate the West African nominate from the southern and eastern G. l. natalensis (Roberts 1933).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">50-55 cm, ca. 440 g. Sexes alike. A medium-sized, nocturnal heron with a stocky build, short legs, stout bill and large eyes and head. Face and hood black, terminating in short crest of black plumes. Mantle, back, rump and tail greyish brown, contrasting with white patch formed by lanceolate scapulars, most conspicuous in flight. Chin, throat and patch around eye white. Neck and breast rufous-chestnut, grading to white on belly. Bill black, base of lower mandible sometimes yellow. Large eyes brown or chestnut, more yellow in non-breeding season; surrounded by pale lemon yellow patch. Legs and feet green to orange-yellow. Juvenile browner with large white terminal spots on wing coverts and boldly streaked underparts (Brown et al. 1982, Allan 2005e). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A secretive and easily overlooked species that is widespread but generally sparse throughout its extensive Afrotropical range. Occurs widely in West Africa from Senegal eastwards to Nigeria, and southwards to Cameroon, Gabon, Congo and northern Angola. In Central and East Africa there are scattered populations from Democratic Republic of the Congo to eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, and southwards from Tanzania to Malawi, Zambia and southern Angola (del Hoyo et al. 1992). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In southern Africa most records are east of 20°E, with concentrations in the Okavango Delta and Chobe regions of northern Botswana where it is particularly regular (Randall 1994, Martin 1997), as well as the Caprivi zone in northern Namibia. Isolated records along the lower Kunene possibly represent a localised but largely overlooked population (Braine 1988). In Zimbabwe it occurs primarily along the Zambezi and Save rivers, with scattered records elsewhere (Martin 1997). In Mozambique the species is surprisingly scarce but almost certainly widely overlooked (Clancey 1996), with only one record at Cahora Bassa mentioned by Parker (2005), and no recent records south of the Save River (Parker 1999). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Within the region, the species occurs very sparsely in low-lying, high-rainfall areas of northern and eastern South Africa and Swaziland, extending westwards along the south coast to about Knysna, Western Cape (Martin 1997). Due to its nocturnal habits and secretive nature it is probably widely overlooked, even in well-monitored areas, and local populations have recently been discovered in several locations. Nevertheless, its distribution is fragmented and highly localised, and the only areas where clustering of atlas records is discernable are Kruger National Park and the escarpment region of Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Martin (1997) proposed that a comparison of SABAP1 atlas data and the map presented by Brooke (1984) may suggest local extinction events have occurred in southern KwaZulu-Natal and the littoral belt of Eastern Cape. Brooke (1984) was concerned that the population on the lower Vaal River and its tributaries may have been lost, and noted that the species was previously recorded down to the Kimberley area in Northern Cape; however, the population on the Vaal persists, and it was recently recorded on the Vaal near Sasolburg and Bothaville (SABAP2 data). Similar concerns about an apparent contraction in the former Transvaal are hopefully unfounded as the species still occurs at low densities in North West, Gauteng and Limpopo provinces (Tarboton et al. 1987, Martin 1997, SABAP2 data). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 datasets reveals a similarly scattered occurrence pattern but relatively little overlap of records and localities between the two atlas periods; this lack of congruence is probably a reflection of the secretiveness of the species, and possibly nomadic movements, rather than actual changes in distribution. Nevertheless, the most recent atlas data did not re-confirm its occurrence along the upper Limpopo, the KwaZulu-Natal/Free State border region, or the KwaZulu-Natal coastal belt, and the species has not recently been recorded west of Uitenhage in Eastern Cape. There are a small number of records from the lower Orange and Fish rivers close to Vioolsdrif on the border of South Africa and Namibia (Shaughnessy and Shaughnessy 1980, Simmons and Allan 2002), which may represent vagrants or more likely a small overlooked population (Parker and Barnes 2000). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was recorded in 57 grid cells during SABAP1, suggesting a maximum range of 40 000 km2, of which less than 1% (i.e. less than400 km2) comprises its specialised riverine habitat (Parker and Barnes 2000). Conversely, it was recorded from only 32 15' x 15' grid cells in SABAP2, corresponding to an actual range of only c. 224 km2 and a decrease of 44%. However, the scarcity of data complicates interpretation and this may be an underestimate.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The total regional population was estimated at 500-1 000 individuals by Parker and Barnes (2000), and this estimate is probably still accurate. These authors considered Kruger National Park (40-60 pairs) and the Middle Vaal River (50-60 pairs) to be the two most important sites for the species, supporting 10-25% of the regional population between them (Barnes 1998). Gauteng Province is estimated to support approximately 3.7% of the region's population, i.e. 10-20 pairs (Whittington-Jones 2011). The population in Swaziland is estimated at five breeding pairs (Parker 1994). Population densities are not documented.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be stable, in the absence of evidence for any declines or substantial threats (BirdLife International 2014bh). While the species is naturally rare and localised, having highly specialised habitat requirements and thus being confined to limited riverine habitats, the regional population is thought to be declining, based on apparent reductions in range and continued threats to its habitats. Similar patterns occur in syntopic riverine specialists such as African Finfoot Podica senegalensis, Pel's Fishing Owl Scotopelia peli and Half-collared Kingfisher Alcedo semitorquata. </p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A crepuscular and nocturnal hunter of small fish, amphibians, molluscs, crustaceans and insects, sought along muddy or vegetated shorelines or on rafts of floating vegetation (Allan 2005e). Sometimes hunts near floodlights (Hanmer 1989b). During the day rests in thick riverine vegetation including trees, shrubbery, tangled thickets and occasionally reedbeds, that offer shade and concealment. Mostly along clear, swift- or slow-flowing perennial rivers and streams with forested banks and overhanging vegetation, chiefly in Woodland and Savannah biomes but also in more open country (Allan 2005e), below 1 500 m (Parker and Barnes 2000). Occurs on both large rivers (especially where dissected by islands, or near rapids) and smaller streams (Tarboton et al. 1987). May also be encountered in mangrove swamps, along coastal lagoons with thick fringing cover, and along wooded margins of lakes. Has bred on small dams and crocodile farms (Randall 1994). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Quiet, secretive and elusive, and adept at avoiding detection. Found singly or in pairs, or in small family parties. A monogamous, solitary breeder, laying 2-3 eggs on a platform hidden in thick vegetation over water or occasionally in bushes, trees or reeds or among rocks not directly over water; rarely in more exposed positions (Tarboton 2011). Nests are usually less than1 m above the water, but occasionally up to 8 m high. Frequently constructs new nests close to previous ones, but seldom re-uses nests in successive years (Tarboton 2011). Mostly sedentary, but may undergo local movements linked to rainfall and flood-levels (Martin 1997). Breeding has been recorded year-round but peaks August-November (Tarboton 2011).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-backed Night Heron is one of eleven local waterbird species primarily restricted to rivers; seven of these are considered Threatened or Near Threatened. Degradation and clearance of sensitive riverbank habitats is the primary threat to this species, especially for agriculture and through overgrazing in densely populated rural areas (Parker and Barnes 2000). It is unclear whether clearing of alien vegetation along rivers (such as through the Working for Water programme) has a positive or negative effect on the species. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Because of the White-backed Night Heron's reliance on rivers, consequences of detrimental factors are not limited to the point of impact but also occur downstream. Likewise, dams and other impoundments may have major ecological impacts downstream, with attendant impacts likely to accrue to species such as the White-backed Night Heron. Impoundments cause reduced river flow and attenuated flood peaks, as well as altered seasonality and temperature of flow, sediment loads, channel morphology and water chemistry (Parker and Barnes 2000). Dramatic rises in water levels and aseasonal floods in regulated waterways are a threat during the breeding season, as nests are usually built close to the water surface. Reduction of water flow, either through changes in river catchments, e.g. from invasive alien plants, or through increased water abstraction is a further threat. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Aquatic systems are also threatened by siltation, soil erosion, pollutants and eutrophication. The species is very sensitive to diurnal disturbance and the presence of secluded roosts is an important factor in habitat selection (HN Chittenden pers. comm.). Ribbon development along the coastline and particularly coastal rivers is of concern (Parker and Barnes 2000). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation measures are currently underway. The species is represented reasonably well in IBAs. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">While local protection and restoration efforts are commendable, the long-term conservation of the White-backed Night Heron and other aquatic and riverine species will ultimately depend on effective management of rivers at the ecosystem-level through national, provincial and municipal initiatives. In particular, riverside vegetation cannot be protected until alternative economic strategies are available to rural farmers, who modify it for cultivation (Parker and Barnes 2000). In the short-term, the species is thus dependent on existing protected areas. As it has bred successfully at small artificial impoundments, simulating its ecological requirements at such sites may be an effective conservation measure (Parker and Barnes 2000). A full census of suitable river systems should be conducted to modify current population estimates, determine linear densities and investigate exact habitat requirements; such efforts could simultaneously contribute to research on other co-occurring threatened riverine specialists.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Bald Ibis Geronticus calvus satisfies the population criterion for regionally Vulnerable (population size estimated to number less than10 000 mature individuals and a predicted continuing decline of greater than 10% in three generations). </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is endemic to the region, was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and is listed as globally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Monotypic. One of only two species in the genus Geronticus, the other being the globally Critically Endangered Northern Bald (or Waldrapp) Ibis G. eremita that breeds in Morocco and Syria, and migrates to Ethiopia. </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">70-81 cm. A peculiar ibis with a unique bald, fleshy, bulging red crown. The sexes are alike in plumage although males are longer-billed and longer-legged. Plumage dark with green-blue iridescence; maroon to copper iridescence on shoulder. Feathered ruff around base of neck; hackles of ruff reduced in non-breeding adults. Face and upper throat bare and white. Neck dark and feathered. Bill, eye, legs and feet red. Immature similar but with duller, less domed crown, off-white face and less pronounced neck-ruff. Juveniles lack iridescence and have duller bare parts (Barnes 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Bald Ibis is endemic to the region, occurring in north-eastern Free State, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, inland areas of KwaZulu-Natal, most of Lesotho and western Swaziland; the species is naturally re-establishing in Eastern Cape, just south of the Lesotho border (Pocock and Uys 1967, Cooper and Edwards 1969, Bonde 1993, Allan 1997c, Barnes 2005). Southern Bald Ibis have been seen as far north as Polokwane (Limpopo) and Ezemvelo Nature Reserve (Gauteng/Mpumalanga); south-west to Ladybrand (Free State); south to Lady Grey, Barkly East, Naudesnek and Lusikisiki (Eastern Cape); and east to Amatikulu Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (KwaZulu-Natal). In Swaziland, the species occurs in the high-lying western grasslands and in two protected areas, namely Malolotja National Park and Mantenga Nature Reserve (Monadjem et al. 2003)</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Between 2007 and 2011, counts were made at 166 of the known breeding sites, including 124 active colonies with a total of 3 333 birds and 689 breeding pairs (nests) recorded. Of 114 colonies with both historical (1965-2005) and recent data, 37 were found to be abandoned, i.e. no birds were present at 32% of historical sites. This provides a global estimate of c. 246 active colonies with a global population size of 7 227 ± 709 individuals. Given an average count at breeding sites of 3.96 birds per nest, this suggests around 1 825 ± 180 breeding pairs and 3 290-4 010 mature individuals. Confidence in this population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional (and global) population is in decline. Matched historical and recent counts (2007-2011) were available for 35 colonies. Of these, 26 colonies declined in size and 28 declined in numbers of nests. Conversely, seven colonies showed slight to moderate increases in size and nest counts. The average rate of decline, weighted by colony size, implies a decline in breeding adults of around 11% over the past three generations (30 years). Confidence in this population trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Southern Bald Ibis are found mostly in high-altitude grasslands, although they are known to use grasslands right down to the coast, including artificial grassland such as sports fields, golf courses and irrigated meadows (Manry 1985a,b). For breeding, the species requires cliffs with suitable ledges, generally above water. Apart from the modified grasslands mentioned above, the species also uses old maize fields, croplands, firebreaks and open spaces in towns when foraging. A generation length of ten years was provided by BirdLife International (2014bi).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Bald Ibis is threatened by poachers taking eggs and young from breeding ledges, by pesticides and poisoning and, in certain areas, by habitat destruction and degradation caused by open-cast mining, urban development and large-scale commercial farming (Collar et al. 1994, Barnes 2000i). Incidents of poisoning and deaths from aerial spraying and illegal pesticide use have been reported (CL Henderson pers. obs.). In certain areas, the species' habit of using electricity pylons as roost sites results in some mortality from collisions with power-lines. Hunting has also been reported as a threat.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Bald Ibis is listed as Vulnerable under the National Environment Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004 (Act 10 of 2004) and under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal Under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No 7 of 2003. It is listed as Vulnerable in Swaziland and is protected by the Swaziland Game Act 1991. BirdLife South Africa, with support from Eskom, has initiated a Southern Bald Ibis programme, based around the objectives of assessing threats to the species and its habitat, mitigating impacts of these threats, maintaining current population levels and establishing practical guidelines for land-owners and avitourism operators to protect breeding colonies. Regular counts of breeding colonies are being conducted, and should continue.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Species Action Plan for the long-term conservation of the Southern Bald Ibis is recommended. As many as possible of the larger breeding colonies and feeding areas require formal and active protection. Incentives for adopting ibis-friendly farming practices need to be implemented.</p>

<div id="_idContainer820" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Lesser Jacana Microparra capensis is suspected to be in decline and approaching but not attaining the 30% threshold required to qualify the species as regionally Vulnerable under criterion A2. However the population is certainly less than10 000 mature individuals and the decline in the regional population is in excess of 10% over a three generation period satisfying criterion C1 for regionally Vulnerable. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was assessed as Near Threatened in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The smallest of the world's eight jacana species, it is the only species in the genus Microparra. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">15-16 cm, 41 g. Sexes alike in plumage colouration but female slightly larger. A diminutive subtropical jacana, easily confused with half-grown chicks of the far more abundant and widespread African Jacana Actophilornis africanus. Forehead golden, with crown and nape rufous and gradually becoming black on the lower nape. Side of face white. Broad white supercilium with brown eye-stripe below. Mantle, back and wing coverts mottled brown. Underparts white. Flanks rich chestnut but normally concealed by folded wing. Primaries and secondaries black with secondaries having a white trailing edge only visible in flight. Underwing coverts black. Eyes brown. Bill pale brown. Legs and feet greenish grey (Tarboton 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lesser Jacana has a fragmented range throughout tropical and subtropical Africa. In southern Africa, the species occurs in northern Namibia and Zimbabwe, with the Okavango Delta in Botswana and nearby wetland systems being a stronghold. In southern Mozambique it is recorded widely but sparsely (Parker 1999). Within the region, northern KwaZulu-Natal is the only area in which this species breeds regularly. It is mainly a vagrant to north-eastern South Africa, occurring primarily in wet years in small numbers. It is an uncommon visitor to eastern Swaziland (Parker 1994) and is absent from Lesotho. The historical range has contracted significantly; the type specimen was collected from Algoa Bay, Eastern Cape (Allan 2000c) and there are historical records of birds breeding in the Durban area (Stark and Sclater 1906, Clancey 1964, Brooke 1984). The species exhibits incidences of vagrancy with occasional records from the Mpumalanga Highveld and Hwange Panveld, Zimbabwe (Tarboton and Fry 1986). Its transient occurrence is also clearly discernable in the number of isolated records on the distribution map (overleaf). Local movements may be dependent upon rainfall with Allan (2000) making mention that the population may number in the hundreds during suitable conditions, but that the species may be entirely absent during times of drought. The Lesser Jacana has an EoO of c. 244 500 km2, which represents an increase of 4.5% from SABAP1. More worrying is a marked decline in AoO (by c. 54%) since SABAP1, to the current AoO of c. 9 100 km2. It should be noted that only approximately 2% of this area is made up of waterbodies, meaning that the AoO is probably closer to 180 km2. The species was recorded in eight IBAs with iSimangaliso Wetland Park (SA058) being the most important, followed by Mkuze Game Reserve (SA057) and Richards Bay Game Reserve (SA079). Other IBAs included Mapungubwe National Park (SA001), the Nyl River Floodplain (SA008), Umvoti Estuary (SA073) and interestingly the Kwazulu-Natal Mistbelt Forests (SA071) and Kwazulu-Natal Mistbelt Grasslands (SA078) IBAs.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Estimation of population sizes is greatly complicated by the erratic movements and elusive nature of the species; for example, it can be locally common in prime habitat, with estimates of 22 birds/100 ha at St Lucia (Tarboton and Fry 1986) but may disappear within weeks if conditions change. BirdLife International (2014bj) does not provide a global population estimate. Brooke (1984) listed this species as Rare based mainly upon its limited occurrence and small population size. The population in southern Mozambique is thought to probably exceed 100 birds. The regional population is likely less than1 000 mature individuals although this may fluctuate greatly. Confidence in this regional population estimate is low and needs to be verified.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">BirdLife International (2014bj) does not provide a global population trend estimate. The alarming regional decline in AoO of -54% is of concern, particularly as a concomitant decline in population would qualify this species as regionally Endangered. However the occurrence of Lesser Jacana as a breeding species is largely driven by environmental conditions with individuals taking advantage of the creation of seasonal pans, and possibly congregating in years with low rainfall or moving away from the region completely. The relationship between population decline and a decrease in AoO in the case of Lesser Jacana is thus unlikely to be linear. It is however suspected that the regional population is in decline, and that this decline is ongoing and is approaching the 30% over a three-generation period threshold. Confidence in this trend estimate is low and requires verification. </p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is highly localised, showing a preference for shallow water around the edges of permanent and seasonally flooded wetlands, with areas of sparse sedges such as Rhynchosporia, Eliocharis, Cyperus and Juncus spp. (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The Lesser Jacana is sometimes the subject of aggression from the larger African Jacana which may displace or even pursue it (Tarboton 1997a). A density of 22 birds/100 ha was recorded by Tarboton and Fry (1986) although Tarboton (1997) makes mention that most pans are home to at most one or two pairs. The species is a sporadic and unpredictable monogamous breeder at waterbodies where there is good grass or sedge cover (Tarboton 2001). Egg-laying occurs in most months, peaking in March-April; 2-4 eggs are laid (Tarboton 2001). A generation length of 4.8 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014bj). The Lesser Jacana is primarily insectivorous, and forages while walking on floating vegetation, by pecking and scissoring small insects off plant surfaces with its bill, or occasionally climbing stems (Tarboton 2005a).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Major threats to this species are wetland degradation, destruction and interference with floodplain ecology through the impoundment of dams and improper catchment management. Undoubtedly the damming of the Pongola River and creation of the Pongolapoort Dam would have had a significantly adverse impact on Lesser Jacana populations occurring on the Makatini Flats. Thulazihleka Pan, a site at which Lesser Jacana bred regularly but which has been subjected to several pollution events over the past decade, now seems to be devoid of these birds. Habitat loss may have also occurred as result of agricultural conversion, afforestation and industrialisation.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation measures are currently underway. The establishment of the 332 000 ha iSimangaliso Wetland Park in 1999 and, in particular, the removal of plantations from both the Western Shores and Eastern Shores sections of the park, would have benefited this species. Wetland systems are afforded some degree of protection from development through the National Environmental Management Act: Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations and the National Water Act. Certain types of development within or in close proximity to a wetland requires further investigation and where appropriate, species surveys may be required prior to any activity being undertaken. The species is reasonably well represented in the protected areas network.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The conservation of the Lesser Jacana in South Africa depends mainly upon the protection of the complex system of wetlands, river floodplains, lakes and natural pans in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal. The conservation status of the Lesser Jacana is recognised by Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife and the species is considered protected in terms of the provincial legislation (Kwazulu-Natal Environmental, Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Bill, 2015) and is included as a key species within the province's systematic conservation plan. It is imperative that the integrity of the existing wetland systems within the distribution of the Lesser Jacana are managed to ensure suitable breeding habitat. In addition, the catchments of these areas need to be conserved to ensure the appropriate hydrological functioning of these systems. </p>

Records in Limpopo, Gauteng, Free State and northern extremities of Northern Cape are attributable to misidentifications of the Northern Black Korhaan. A comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 reporting rates indicates a decrease in 226 of the 284 QDSs in which the species was reported in either project (Hofmeyr 2012). The species has been recorded in 20 IBAs in the region.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size has not been quantified and requires urgent investigation. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Historically described by Stark and Sclater (1906) as very common and certainly the most abundant of all game birds throughout the Cape Colony; by Uys and Macleod (1967) as one of the dominant species of Coastal Fynbos; by Clancey (1973) as locally common to common; and by Hockey et al. (1989) as a common resident. Although the Southern Black Korhaan still occurs at relatively high densities in small patches of optimal habitat, it is now generally scarce and localised, and the population is undergoing a decline. Comparing reporting rates from SABAP1 and SABAP2, populations in Western Cape showed the most widespread reduction in reporting rates (86% of QDSs), followed by Northern Cape (73%), and Eastern Cape (71%). It is unlikely that these declines were an artefact of the change in atlasing protocol (Hofmeyr 2012), as the species is conspicuous. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Coordinated Avifaunal Roadcounts (CAR) data suggest that the Overberg and Swartland populations declined between 1998 and 2010, while a small portion of the Eastern Cape population showed an increase in numbers after a period of initial decline during a similar period (Hofmeyr 2012). These data showed a higher density in Eastern Cape, which may be explained by the smaller extent of habitat transformation in the Karoo, or may be an artefact of greater detectability in Karoo vegetation compared to Fynbos. Overall, based on data from both SABAP and CAR, the population is thought to have declined by greater than 30% since SABAP1 (1987-1993). The confidence in this estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Black Korhaan occurs in the Fynbos Biome, mainly in Renosterveld and Strandveld, and in the Nama and Succulent Karoo biomes (Crowe et al. 1994). The species shows a distinct preference for natural habitats over transformed land, although it is seen in cultivated land where little natural habitat remains available to it (Hofmeyr 2012). However, it is absent from pristine natural vegetation that is too dense and high to permit easy terrestrial mobility and good visibility. A generation length of 10.3 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014bk).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to the species is probably habitat loss and degradation due to cultivation (Hofmeyr 2012). Much further research is required to understand the reasons for the decline of this species; however, climate change, human disturbance and increased nest predation by corvids may have also played a role (Hofmeyr 2012).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Young et al. (2003) advocated engagement with land-owners to develop and implement appropriate measures to protect large terrestrial birds. Following consultation and discussions with land-owners, the Animal Demography Unit of the University of Cape Town published a booklet titled Farming for the future: farming sustainably with nature which includes information on conservation measures to be put in place for large terrestrial bird species such as the Southern Black Korhaan. The conservation of natural veld on farms and the prevention of excessive disturbance of natural veld by livestock are advocated for this species in particular.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Biodiversity stewardship programmes to formalise the protection of key habitats is a priority. Additionally, where possible, degraded or disused lands should be allowed to revert to natural vegetation. Human disturbance and disturbance by domestic animals should also be minimised. Corridors of indigenous vegetation linking isolated patches of natural veld would also benefit this species. Coordinated Avifaunal Roadcounts (CAR) participants should ideally collect basic habitat availability data along the length of routes to improve habitat use models.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of White-bellied Korhaan Eupodotis senegalensis satisfies the population size-reduction criterion for regionally Vulnerable (=30% decline over the past three generations where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased and may not be reversible, based on a decline in AoO, EoO and/or quality of habitat). It is believed that this trend will continue for the next three generations.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this species occurs within the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in the 2000 assessment. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-bellied Korhaan (more widely known as the White-bellied Bustard) has had a confusingly dynamic history in terms of its taxonomy and nomenclature (reviewed by Allan 2010a, 2010b). The type specimen was collected in the Eastern Cape by Levaillant in the late 1700s. This specimen was sold in 1793 (and subsequently disappeared) but the sale catalogue prepared by Lichtenstein, served as the formal type description of the species, as Otis cafra. However, Lichtenstein's son later erroneously attributed his father's description to Denham's Bustard (now Neotis denhami), and not White-bellied Korhaan (Denham's Bustard's actual type specimen was collected at Lake Chad, some forty years after Levaillant's Eastern Cape bird). A separate specimen of a White-bellied Korhaan from Senegal undeservingly carried the type description for the species, published by Vieillot in 1820 as Otis senegalensis. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This mistake was discovered a century later. The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled to suppress the name cafra, changing Denham's Bustard to denhami and retaining senegalensis for White-bellied Korhaan in the mid-1950s. Regrettably, this change was not adapted in South African ornithological literature, in which the name Eupodotis cafra was used for the White-bellied Korhaan until it was finally corrected in 2005 (Allan 2005i). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Soon thereafter, a new development occurred in the proposal that the isolated South African population be elevated to species-level, as Barrow's Korhaan E. barrowii. Five subspecies of the White-bellied Korhaan are generally recognised (del Hoyo et al. 1996): E. s. senegalensis (Mauritania and Guinea to Sudan and Eritrea), E. s. canicollis (Ethiopia to Tanzania), E. s. erlangeri (Kenya and western Tanzania), mackenziei (Central Africa, south to Zambia and Angola) and E. s. barrowii (South Africa). However, Collar (1996) was of the opinion that subtle differences in plumage and call alone do not justify the treatment of barrowii as a separate species, but Barnes (2000k) insisted that the taxonomic status of the White-bellied Korhaan deserves investigation, and the recognition of barrowii rapidly gained traction in the popular literature. This elevation would be of particular significance for conservation, raising the status of the taxon to a threatened South African endemic, instead of merely an outlying population of a widespread Afrotropical species listed as Least Concern.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The affinities and indeed validity of some subspecific taxa introduced further confusion. Isolated sight records of White-bellied Korhaans from northern Namibia (attributable to the subspecies mackenziei), raised the question of whether mackenziei should be included with barrowii under Barrow's (Southern White-bellied) Korhaan E. barrowii or included with the other three African races as (Northern) White-bellied Bustard E. senegalensis. Sinclair and Ryan (2003) opted for the latter, despite the similarity of barrowii and mackenziei, both of which differ from populations in East Africa in e.g. having a rufous hind-neck and lacking a moustachial stripe. Based on current evidence, the South African population is best considered a subspecies.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">44-55 cm, 0.9-1.1 kg. An attractive medium-sized korhaan that is usually detected by its far-carrying honking or croaking calls. Sexes differ in size and plumage colouration. In adult male, crown and front of neck blue-grey; hind neck rufous in southern races barrowii and mackenziei (but blue-grey in the northern races senegalensis, canicollis and erlangeri). Remainder of upperparts tawny-rufous, lacking distinct markings. Face white, with black patch on nape and throat. White underside diagnostic in both sexes. Females lack blue colouration and dark throat markings. Females of race barrowii distinguished by buffy face (white in other races) and darker back. Bill dusky with pinkish base. Eyes brown. Legs whitish yellow. Juvenile similar to female, but has speckled or vermiculated crown (Allan 2005i).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-bellied Korhaan is patchily distributed in the Afrotropics from West Africa to South Africa (Allan 2005i). Of the five subspecies, barrowii is geographically separated from other races further north in Africa, being restricted to eastern South Africa and adjacent south-western Swaziland (Allan 1997d, Barnes 2000k) with an AoO of 67 249 km2. Scattered records exist from extreme south-eastern Botswana at Kanye and Kaotwe Pan (grid cell 2525A) (Cyrus and Robson 1980, Penry and Jahns 1994) and it may occasionally wander into the lowlands of Lesotho (Bonde 1993). Densities vary greatly in different parts of the range, but overall it is most common in the Highveld regions east of Potchefstroom (Maclean and Robert 1985) to southern Mpumalanga (where it occurs mainly in the Wakkerstroom district; Moreira 2004), as well as in north-eastern Free State and the upper districts and midlands of KwaZulu-Natal. Isolated remnant populations occur on the Polokwane Plateau and Waterberg Plateau in Limpopo (Tarboton et al. 1987, Allan 1997d). Isolated populations also persist in the Eastern Cape: the species occurs in a fragmented band from west of Lesotho to Grahamstown, with a further remnant around Humansdorp. The White-bellied Korhaan is apparently absent from the former Transkei (Quickelberge 1989, Allan 1997d), although this may be due to inadequate surveys. The EoO has decreased by 15% between the SABAP1 and SABAP2 periods, while the AoO has decreased by 50% over the same period. The White-bellied Korhaan is well represented in the IBA network, being recorded at 14 different sites.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014bl) and evaluating the conservation status of such a low-density, widely distributed species is problematic (Senyatso et al. 2013). It is described as uncommon to locally common, with a measured density of about 2.0-2.5 birds/km2 in suitable habitat (Barnes 2000k, Tarboton 2011). Moreira (2004) recorded 151 birds in 68 groups in an area of 3 200 km2 or 0.047 birds/km2. On average, territories are recorded every 25 km during line transects, although they can be spaced as little as 2 km apart in optimal habitat (Allan 2005i). Barnes (2000k) estimated there to be less than5 000 mature individuals in the region in 2000. A comparison of the AoO estimates between SABAP1 and SABAP2 suggests that the species is now found in only 50% of its former habitat. If the relationship between the reported decrease in AoO and the regional population is linear, this would mean a reduction in population size of c. 2 000 mature individuals resulting in a current population of c. 3 000 birds. Likewise, if the densities proposed by Moreira (0.047 birds/km2) are extrapolated across the AoO measured in SABAP2 (67 249 km2), the regional population would be c. 3 160 individuals. This does assume that the species is distributed evenly across its entire AoO, which is unlikely. An estimate of 3 000 mature birds is provided. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be decreasing due to habitat destruction, but not at a rate sufficient to qualify the species as globally Vulnerable (BirdLife International 2014bl). Assuming the population estimates provided above are accurate, the decrease in the regional population over the past three generations (10.3 years) would be c. 73%, hence an assessment of regionally Vulnerable. Generation length was calculated based on extrapolated mean age at first breeding and extrapolated maximum longevity in the wild (BirdLife International 2014bl). Confidence in this is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-bellied Korhaan is a near-endemic to the Grassland Biome (Allan 1997d, 2005i), sometimes occurring in ecotones with savannah and fynbos (Allan 2005i). Although most sources state that the species requires longer grass (30-60 cm) than most other bustards and generally avoids overgrazed and recently burnt areas (Moreira 2004), the birds do occasionally move into open areas in winter to forage (Moreira 2004), including recently burnt grassland. On farms they may also make use of cultivated pastures as an artificial grassland habitat (Young et al. 2003), but are found in crop fields only after harvesting (D Swanepoel pers. obs.).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The main threats is a familiar list of problems also facing other bustard species. The relative severity and potential impact of these threats have not been quantified or even assessed, but of particular concern are habitat loss and degradation due to agriculture, afforestation (invasive alien vegetation and timber plantations), overgrazing, urban development, unsuitable burning practices, and other habitat modifications as a result of growing human populations (Moreira 2004, Allan 2005i). Clancey (1972) mentioned fires as a threat to chicks, but this is unlikely to constitute a major threat during the breeding season in the summer rainfall area. The loss of habitat to bush encroachment poses a threat to White-bellied Korhaans, although the species appears to be adaptable to low levels of woody cover in grasslands. Apart from habitat loss, the threat of subsistence hunting and poaching, due to high human densities, also needs to be considered. Collisions with power-lines do not seem to pose as serious a threat as it does to larger bustard species (Shaw 2009), with only a single record of a male killed in this fashion on record (Allan 2005i).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Biodiversity stewardship programmes in the relevant biomes will reduce further habitat loss and unsustainable persecution. In 2010, BLSA formed the Bustard Working Group, which includes interested parties involved in the conservation of species belonging to this family. Research and conservation of White-bellied Korhaans is currently being undertaken, and forms part of a larger BirdLife South Africa initiative focused on grassland conservation. Funding for this research was partly generated through a sponsorship campaign run by a private birdwatcher (N Perrins); such initiatives can simultaneously help raise awareness of the plight of the White-bellied Korhaan and other species.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There is a danger that declines over long periods go unrecognised and hence unremedied; the White-bellied Korhaan is a prime candidate for this risk. Conservation of larger parts of the grassland biome on private and government level (formal protection currently less than3%) is strongly recommended. Proper management of fires and grazing pressure should be implemented in conservation areas and on private land, in order to create heterogeneity in the structural and floristic components of preferred habitats. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population of Red Lark Calendulauda burra satisfies the threshold for Vulnerable under the reduction in population size criterion (an estimated, inferred or suspected population size reduction of 30% over the past three generations, where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased). In addition, the population size is estimated to number less than10 000 mature individuals, all of which occur within a single population.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Red Lark is endemic to the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As is the case with many other cryptic southern African passerines, the Red Lark has a complex taxonomic history. Some authors have argued that it should be seen as a subspecies of the widespread Karoo Lark Calendulauda albescens, or the localised Namibian endemic Dune Lark C. erythochlamys; it has also been placed in the alternative genera Ammomanes, Certhilauda and Mirafra. However, recent evidence suggests that, although it is closely allied with Karoo, Dune and Barlow's (C. barlowi) larks, there is no evidence for hybridisation between these species and the Red Lark (Ryan and Bloomer 1997). It is now placed in the genus Calendulauda. In addition, three debatable subspecies have been described: the plain-backed, reddish nominate C. b. burra from the north-western dunes around Aggenys; the streaky-backed brown C. b. harei from the central alluvial plains; and the plain, dark red C. b. aridula from the dunes around Van Wyksvlei. However, these phenotypes overlap and interbreed and are not distinctly separable genetically (Myburgh and Steyn 1989, Ryan and Bloomer 1997). See also Brooke (1984).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">18-19 cm. A large, robust lark with a long tail, heavy flight action and a short, deep bill, which appears stubby in the field. Occurs in two distinct forms: populations occurring on red dune crests mainly sandy red to deep brick-red in colour with limited or no streaking above; birds occurring in dwarf shrublands on clay soils mainly rufous-brown with moderate to distinct but narrow blackish streaking above. All have heavy, blotchy, blackish brown, wedge-shaped spots on the breast; some birds show a few scattered flank streaks. Face boldly patterned with a white supercilium and eye-surround, black eye-stripe and black malar and moustachial stripes. Chin and throat white; remainder of underparts white or pale cream. Bill blackish horn, base paler. Eyes brown. Legs and feet greyish brown. Sexes are alike, but the female is smaller and sometimes paler in plumage. Juveniles are redder and brighter rufous above, with whitish-tipped crown and back feathers imparting a spotted appearance (Keith et al. 1992, Ryan and Bloomer 1997).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Red Lark is endemic to South Africa's Northern Cape Province. Its restricted and fragmented distribution mostly follows red sand dunes south of the Orange River, and in particular the active and palaeo-dunes of coarse-grained, hematite-stained, deep red sands overlying a Precambrian basement in the Koa River Valley, and the stable dunes of finer-grained red and yellow sands overlying Karoo sediments to the south-west; it also occurs on shales and alluvial plains in parts of its range (Dean 1997b). It occurs in areas with an annual rainfall of less than100-200 mm, but mostly within the 100 mm isohyet, in a mainly spring and autumn rainfall region (Dean et al. 1991). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The distribution encapsulates the band from east of Steinkopf, eastwards to Aggenys and south to the Kliprand area, in the Pofadder, Kenhardt and Vanwyksvlei districts, and south to Klein Soutpan and east to Brandvlei and isolated dunes in the Brospan area (Dean et al. 1991, Barnes 2000l). Sight records from near Kenhardt in the early 1960s and 1985 suggest that it occasionally occurs further to the north-east. There are also two putative specimen records from southern Namibia: one from dunes north of Oranjemund and one from Kleinkaras, but these are considered doubtful (Ryan and Bloomer 1997) or may reflect occasional vagrancy (Dean and Ryan 2005b). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Red Lark has lost c. 75% of its habitat in the last century to overgrazing and degradation. An apparently dramatic decrease in EoO and AoO is suggested when comparing SABAP1 data (on which the Vulnerable assessment of Barnes (2000l) was based), and SABAP2 data. The c. 52% decrease in EoO of this species is partly an effect of limited field surveys within its restricted, barren and sparsely populated range. Dedicated atlasing efforts in areas where it was previously recorded are likely to reveal that it persists in at least some other localities, particularly in the east of its distribution range. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Dean et al. (1991) estimated its total global EoO to be 112 500 km2; however, at least 86% of this area represents unsuitable habitat for the Red Lark and a global EoO of 15 850 km2 is thus more likely (Dean et al. 1991). The 80% decrease in AoO is again partly an effect of incomplete sampling. This species was recorded in 45 quarter-degree grid cells during SABAP1, and in only 18 grid cells (representing 30 pentads) during SABAP2; only 9 grid cells overlap between the two atlas periods. However, excluding ad-hoc atlas cards and incidental observations, 21 of the grid cells in which the Red Lark was recorded in SABAP1 had not been surveyed in SABAP2 at the time of writing, and a further 12 only superficially explored. Of the 15 850 km2 estimated to represent the global EoO of this species by Dean et al. (1991), about one third (5 625 km2) constitutes suitable habitat for this species, but only a quarter of this (1 400 km2) is occupied. It is unknown to what extent the AoO of this species has changed since the estimation of Dean et al. (1991).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Red Lark is locally common, but highly localised and fragmented in its distribution (Dean and Ryan 2005b). Brooke (1984), considered it Indeterminate but probably Rare, i.e. a species which is not at present threatened, but is at risk. It was classified as Near Threatened by Collar and Stuart (1985). It is probably most continuously distributed and numerous in the Koa River Valley in Bushmanland, where densities of up to 1 bird/5.7 ha occur. Some 75% of a total of 5 625 km2 of historically suitable habitat has been overgrazed and degraded. The current AoO of 1 400 km2 is estimated to support c. 9 400 birds, calculated at 1 pair/30 ha (Dean et al. 1991). The morphologically distinct eastern population, occurring around Vanwyksvlei, has experienced the most severe decreases (Ryan and Bloomer 1997). The current regional population is certainly greater than 10 000 mature individuals, but an accurate estimate is not currently possible.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There is no evidence of a historic range contraction, but local population decreases and disappearances from some sites are documented (Barnes 2000l). However, decreases in EoO and AoO may be due to incomplete sampling as opposed to real declines. The current population trend is unknown.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species occurs on red sands on dune slopes and crests, favouring areas where large 50 cm-tall tussock grasses, such as Stipagrostis ciliata, S. brevifolia and Brachiaria glomerata are dominant. It requires multi-level vegetation, with annual large-seeded grasses for food, perennial grasses with plumed awns for nesting material and nest sites, and scattered small trees and shrubs 1-1.5 m in height, such as Parkinsonia africana and Monechma incanum, from which to sing and to provide it with shade. In optimum habitat, perennial vegetation cover is 5-25%, and less than a third comprises woody shrubs; after rains, the growth of annuals and low forbs increases vegetation cover to c. 50%. The Red Lark occasionally forages in grassy inter-dune areas, but avoids bare dune troughs (Dean et al. 1991). Food items (taken from the ground or directly from vegetation, or excavated from sand using the heavy bill) include large, smooth seeds of grasses, forbs and shrubs and adult and larval insects. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Contrary to the red, plain-backed dune birds, a dorsally streaked and browner form occurs in dwarf shrublands on plains on shales, scrub-lined sandy washes, or on clay pans with pebbles (Ryan and Bloomer 1997). It is mostly absent from eroded dunes and areas where shrubs dominate the vegetation and sites with silty, gravelly, calcerous soils and succulent, shrubby vegetation (Dean et al. 1991). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The biggest threat to the Red Lark is the poor representation of the species in formally protected areas, with less than100 birds (c. 2% of the estimated global population) occurring in state-owned nature reserves (Siegfried 1992). As a naturally range-restricted species and habitat specialist, the Red Lark is influenced by changes in the structure of the sensitive dune vegetation it inhabits (Barnes 2000l). It is threatened mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation through the impacts of intensive grazing and trampling by domestic livestock, which may cause changes in vegetation structure. Overgrazing reduces vegetation cover and available food, especially if coupled with droughts. A decrease in perennial grass and shrub cover may lead to eroding and shifting of dunes (Dean et al. 1991). Cattle uproot forbs and graze down grasses such as the important Stipagrostis ciliata, while sheep selectively remove forbs and annual grasses. Goats are thought to have the least impact on Red Lark habitat by browsing shrubs and some grasses, but leaving Stipagrostris untouched. Climate change may have a detrimental effect on range-restricted species linked to specific soil types, such as the Red Lark (Simmons et al. 2004). At a small number of publicly accessible and well-known sites, disturbance by birdwatchers may have a limited negative effect on the species.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific research or conservation actions are currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species is poorly represented in state-owned reserves (Siegfried 1992). However, important populations occur in three IBAs: Mattheus-Gat Conservation area (SA034; 400-700 birds), Haramoep and Black Mountain Mine Nature Reserve (SA035; 1 500-2 000 birds) and Bitterputs Conservation Area (SA036; 300-600 birds). With the exception of Black Mountain Mine Nature Reserve, these IBAs consist of privately owned farms, typically extensively grazed by livestock. Proactive conservation measures are essential in these high priority areas, which support a significant proportion of the global population of the Red Lark; Black Mountain Mine Nature Reserve alone supports c. 7.5% of the global population, and together with the surrounding properties constituting the IBA, may hold 15-20% of the world's Red Larks. This presents companies and private land-owners with the opportunity to make an important contribution to biodiversity conservation (Barnes and Anderson 1998). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Cattle stocking should be reduced or eliminated on parts of the properties, particularly in the remaining sensitive red-dune vegetation that the Red Lark is reliant on. In many locations such exclusion zones need only to encompass a small area, given the habitat specificity of the Red Lark. In degraded habitats, re-establishment of appropriate grass and forb communities, and management of grazing levels could lead to population increases or local re-colonisation by Red Larks (Barnes 2000l). Identification of other priority conservation areas, and establishment of reserves or conservancies focused specifically on the Red Lark, should also be undertaken. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Taxonomic studies have shown that birds from the three main habitat zones (north-western dunes, south-central alluvial plains and eastern dunes) do not represent different subspecies. Nevertheless, this variation in habitats and phenotypes should be conserved (Ryan and Bloomer 1997). Populations restricted to localised red dunes, particularly in the east of the range, are under greater threat from grazing than birds living on alluvial plains (Barnes 2000l). An awareness campaign, targeting land-owners whose properties hold Red Larks, will be beneficial in the long-term. As this species and other arid-zone South African endemics are highly sought-after by local and international birdwatchers, controlled avitourism also presents a sustainable and economically valuable indirect conservation strategy and an impetus for local land-owners to conserve the species.</p>

	<p class="Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Caprimulgus natalensis</p>
</div>
<div id="_idContainer867" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Swamp Nightjar Caprimulgus natalensis has been quantified at less than1 000 mature individuals. In addition the species qualifies as Vulnerable under the range-size criterion, having an Area of Occupancy less than2 000 km2 combined with a severely fragmented range.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was listed as Vulnerable in the 2000 assessment. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is polytypic, with 4-7 subspecies recognised. Regional populations belong to the race C. n. natalensis.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">23 cm, 60-65 g. A compact, short-tailed, long-legged nightjar of moist lowland grasslands. Sexes differ mainly in colour and extent of wing and tail markings (white in male, buff in female). Male best identified by broad white outer rectrices; commonly confused with Square-tailed Nightjar C. fossii, but Swamp Nightjar has prominent dark face, and lacks white bar on lesser coverts, white-tipped secondaries, and buffy scapular bar. Voice and habitat are also helpful in separating the two species, Square-tailed Nightjar having a much faster ‘churring' song and occupying woodlands, savannah, and dune scrub rather than wetland edges and coastal grassland (Davies and Allan 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Swamp Nightjar has a geographically extensive but exceptionally fragmented distribution throughout the Afrotropics (Fry et al. 1988). The regional sub-population (contiguous with a small population in far southern Mozambique; Parker 1999) is largely isolated from the remainder of the African range, the next closest populations being in north-western Zimbabwe and northern Botswana (Davies and Allan 2005). Within South Africa, the species is mainly confined to KwaZulu-Natal (Harrison et al. 1997, Parker 2000), with a relict, little-known population in Eastern Cape (Quickelberge 1989). It is mainly restricted to the coastal plain north of the Tugela River, with a stronghold in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Formerly, it had a much more continuous range throughout coastal Kwa&#173;Zulu-Natal, with historical records from the Durban and Pinetown areas (Stark and Sclater 1903, Maclean 1997a), Umzumbe (Ditsong National Museum of Natural History, egg collection) and Umzinto and Ixopo districts (Aubrecht et al. 2004), but had largely disappeared from these areas by the 1970s (Cyrus and Robson 1980). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A small population may still exist on the Oribi Flats, southern KwaZulu-Natal, as a pair has been recorded on Minnehaha Farm, Oribi Flats (30°40'S, 30°15'E) for many years (M Neethling pers. comm.). It also appears on the reserve checklist for Oribi Gorge Nature Reserve, although there are no published records for the reserve within the last 30 years and indigenous grassland is very limited within the reserve boundaries. There are records from Umtamvuna Nature Reserve, Port Edward (Cyrus and Robson 1981), and a few birds were found in the Rennie's Beach grasslands, just outside Port Edward, in 2011 (G Nichols pers. comm.). In the Eastern Cape, this nightjar is known from Mkambati Nature Reserve (Christian 2003, 2006) and the river valleys between Mkambati and the Umtamvuna River (Quickelberge 1989).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no reliable global or regional population estimates. Johnson et al. (1998) provided estimates for KwaZulu-Natal IBAs; totalling these suggests a figure of 530-780 birds. Parker (2000) estimated a total South African population of c. 1 000 birds, but this did not include the Eastern Cape population (V Parker pers. comm.). Although the Swamp Nightjar has suffered a major range contraction in Kwa&#173;&#173;&#173;Zulu-Natal, most of the populations are now protected within conservation areas (e.g. iSimangaliso Wetland Park). The remaining population outside of protected areas in the province is likely to number less than100. The size of the Eastern Cape population, which occurs mainly in areas under subsistence agriculture and pastoralism, is uncertain, but is likely to be less than200 birds. The total regional population is conservatively estimated to be less than1 000 birds. The proportion of the regional population outside of protected areas, and therefore likely to come under threat from impacts such as loss of habitat, is roughly 25%. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The main sub-population in northern KwaZulu-Natal has remained stable since the 1970s (Cyrus and Robson 1980, 1981) versus Maclean (1997a) and SABAP2. Outside of IBAs, the area, extent and quality of habitat has decreased and it is inferred that this has had negative impacts on the population. The isolated Eastern Cape population is likely to be declining owing to increasing human population and pastoral and agricultural pressures, but the paucity of accurate data means that this conclusion requires corroboration. The confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Swamp Nightjar is restricted to moist, subtropical, coastal grasslands, especially those bordering pans, marshes, lagoons or rivers. Observations suggest it prefers thick, lightly grazed, lightly burnt grassland (Hustler and Mitchell 1997, Allan et al. 2003), often with clumps of Lala palms Hyphaene coriacea, but further research is required on its habitat niche. It is resident but may undertake nomadic movements depending on flood-levels. Breeding occurs in early summer (August-December).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Main threats are loss of habitat, due to agriculture (especially sugarcane farming, but also subsistence agriculture in Maputaland), urban development along the KwaZulu-Natal coast, afforestation for timber plantations, wetland drainage, and, potentially, dune mining. Excessive grazing and burning of grasslands may also be detrimental to the Swamp Nightjar. The species is relatively seldom killed by vehicles.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Currently no conservation actions exist for this species.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A Species Action Plan is recommended. Approximately 75% of the regional population of Swamp Nightjar now falls within conservation areas, with iSimangaliso Wetland Park being of particular importance. If these can be preserved, the status of the nightjar within the country should be secure.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Grass-Owl Tyto capensis has experienced a reduction in regional population size and satisfies the population-size criterion for Vulnerable (an observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population size reduction of 30% over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible). In addition, the population of less than10 000 mature individuals is projected to decline by at least 10% within the next three generations. For these reasons, the species is listed as regionally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the species' global range falls within the region. In addition, it was listed as regionally Vulnerable in the 2000 assessment and has undergone a greater than 30% reduction in AoO over the past 15 years.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Grass Owl forms a superspecies with the very similar Eastern Grass Owl Tyto longimembris of India, China, south-east Asia and Australia. The two taxa are treated as conspecific by some authors. Regarding the African population, several races have been proposed, but damarensis (Angola), librata/libratus (Uganda, Kenya) and cameroonensis (Cameroon Highlands) are not considered valid and the species is generally seen as monotypic (Bruce 1999).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">34-37 cm, 420 g. An inconspicuous and relatively quiet ground-roosting owl of wetlands and open grassland. Most likely to be confused with syntopic Marsh Owl Asio capensis but much less likely to be seen during daylight hours, unless disturbed. The sexes are alike. Heart-shaped, densely feathered facial disc white, contrasting with dark, teardrop-shaped eyes but not with whitish bill. Upperparts dark olive-brown, each feather with tiny white spot at tip. Underparts white to pale buff, with scattered dark spots. In flight shows grey-brown remiges crossed by three narrow dark bars; tail dark centrally, grading to white on outer rectrices. Legs feathered buff; feet greyish. Juveniles are darker than adults at fledging, and lack white dorsal spots Kemp (2005c). A buff or rufous coloured facial disc is considered by many authors to further distinguish juveniles from white-faced adults, but is not a reliable trait as there are several recent records of rufous-faced individuals breeding (MD Pretorius pers. comm.).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species occurs in a fragmented fashion from Congo and Angola, eastwards through Democratic Republic of the Congo to Uganda, and from there southwards through southern Tanzania and Zambia to Zimbabwe and South Africa. There is a small isolated population in the highlands of Cameroon (race cameroonensis), and a larger remnant population in Kenya and Tanzania, east of Lake Victoria. Within the region, it is largely confined to areas of higher rainfall in the eastern half of South Africa. It is most commonly reported from Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga, though significant range contraction and/or fragmentation is apparent (Mendelsohn 1997b). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">While historically more widespread in Free State, North West and Limpopo, the species is now known from only a few widely scattered localities in these provinces (Mendelsohn 1997b). The African Grass Owl persists at low densities, but may be under-recorded, in Eastern Cape where it is found between the Lesotho border and East London. A small and isolated remnant population occurs in Western Cape, with occasional reports from the Wilderness Lakes area and in the vicinity of Bredasdorp. There is a single record for the Northern Cape (Birds in Reserves Project database). There are no recent records for Lesotho where the species was once common (Bonde 1993) and only one record for Swaziland (SABAP2). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is habitat-specific, and only a proportion of its distribution represents suitable ecological conditions. A basic model of African Grass Owl habitat, generated for Gauteng using high-resolution land-cover data, showed that a maximum of 25% of rural Gauteng potentially comprised suitable habitat for the species (CA Whittington-Jones and P Compaan unpubl. data). Applying this threshold regionally reduces the estimated AoO to less than29 000 km2. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014bm). Density estimates of one bird/2-6 km2 was generated for Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve, Gauteng during 2009-11 based on intensive surveys of wetland and grassland habitat in various stages of succession (Whittington-Jones 2010). Extrapolation across the region provides a regional population of 5 000-15 000 individuals. While the densities estimated for Suikerbosrand in the late 1970s are relatively low compared to those for the Settlers area of Limpopo Province (Mendelsohn 1989), they are the only recent data available for this species. Nest survival is reportedly high, with 2-3 chicks fledging per nest (Kemp 2005c) and it is therefore possible that 50% or more of free-flying African Grass Owls recorded for Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve towards the end of the breeding season were immature birds. Based upon this, the regional estimate for mature individuals has been adjusted to 2 500-7 500 birds. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is believed to have undergone a reduction in population size of greater than 30% in the past three generations and is projected to decline by at least 10% within the next three generations. However, in the absence of more detailed historical population data, the rate of population decline is difficult to estimate accurately.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">African Grass Owls appear most concentrated in areas with rainfall of 700-800 mm per year (Tarboton and Erasmus 1998) and have been recorded at altitudes from sea-level to 1 900 masl. As its name implies, the species typically roosts and breeds in tall, rank grass or sedges associated with damp substrates such as permanent and non-perennial wetlands and streams (Tarboton et al. 1987, Kemp 2005c), although it will breed in any area of long grass and is not exclusively associated with wetlands. It constructs a series of tunnels, caves and landing platforms around the nest and roost, and therefore requires tall grass that offers concealment from above, and has relatively rigid but pliable blades, such as the grass species Imperata cylindrica. In paired birds, the male and female roost apart. Along wetland edges, Grass Owls may roost in close proximity to Marsh Owls, but are often outnumbered 10:1 by that species. The peak breeding season (February-April) coincides with maximum grass cover. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At night it may hunt over drier and more open habitats near its wetland roost sites, but still prefers hunting in tall grassland to short grassland, wetlands or croplands (Kemp 2005c). However, being opportunistic hunters responsive to rodent outbreaks, African Grass Owls may hunt or even breed in sub-optimal habitats in years of high rodent abundance. Such habitats include sparse woodland (Mendelsohn 1989), scattered thorn scrub with dense ground cover, old fields (Tarboton et al. 1987, Kemp 2005c) and planted pasture (CA Whittington-Jones pers. obs.). Western Cape populations are found in Fynbos (Dean and Dowsett 1986) or Renosterveld (Cameron 1999), usually near water in thick Stenotaphrum grass or Juncus sedges. Birds in otherwise atypical habitats may represent wandering non-breeding adults or dispersing immatures. The generation length of six years is the mean of two calculated values derived from published and/or extrapolated estimates of mean age at first breeding, maximum longevity in the wild and mean annual adult survival (BirdLife International 2014bm). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to the African Grass Owl in the region is loss of habitat. Between 1994 and 2005, the combined footprint of urbanisation, afforestation, mining and cultivation in the three provinces that comprise the remaining core of the African Grass Owl's range in South Africa, i.e. KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Gauteng, increased by an estimated 8.5%. The extent of potential African Grass Owl habitat affected remains to be assessed, but loss of wetland and associated grassland habitat is expected to exceed 20% in the next three generations. In support of this somewhat speculative suggestion, in Mpumalanga alone development applications between 2005 and 2010 covered 72% of the province. Applications were primarily for prospecting and mining for coal and covered 90% of areas in the province regarded as having high importance for groundwater re-charge and 80% of those areas with high importance for water run-off, thus increasing the probability that African Grass Owl habitat will be affected. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Fire and grazing are important tools for the management of grassland and wetland habitats, but regular heavy grazing pressure and too frequent burning prevent the development of rank grassland habitat required by African Grass Owls (Brooke 1984, Jansen et al. 1999). Their habit of nesting on the ground makes eggs and chicks vulnerable to fire and trampling by livestock (Tarboton and Erasmus 1998, Whittington-Jones 2010). Wetland drainage schemes and incompatible farming practices may explain the apparent absence of this species from Lesotho, much of Eastern Cape (Brooke 1984) and more recently from large areas of its former range in the rest of South Africa. In a slightly more positive vein, given that it is nocturnal and roosts in tall, dense grass during the day, under-recording is a problem. The species frequently hunts along road verges (Ansara 2004), where it is likely preying on rodents attracted to grain spilled by passing trucks. Consequently, African Grass Owls are frequently killed by vehicles at night, and are well-represented in museum collections. Collisions with vehicles are a significant cause of direct mortality: 27% of the 554 owl carcasses recovered from portions of two roads in Gauteng between October 2001 to September 2003 were those of African Grass Owls (Ansara 2004). Entanglement with barbed-wire fences is another potentially significant, but poorly documented cause of mortality.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Currently, there are only limited, incipient measures that are linked to basic research. In 2009, the Endangered Wildlife Trust established the African Grass Owl Task Force. This body draws on the expertise of stakeholders to conduct research, gather information, and create awareness to further conservation of the species. Examples of such initiatives include ongoing research into spatial requirements of the species, targeted surveys of suitable habitat and collation of published and unpublished distribution data for use in land-use planning, annual monitoring of selected populations, and collection of mortality data to assist in identification of emerging threats.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Viable habitat patches that are still known to support African Grass Owls must be mapped and incorporated into relevant regional conservation plans. Fire and livestock grazing regimes that are compatible with the habitat requirements of the species must be determined and effectively communicated to land managers. A Species Management Plan is recommended.</p>

</div>

<div id="_idContainer891" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Great White Pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus has been quantified at c. 2 500 pairs, restricted to less than5 breeding locations, and is vulnerable to short-term human activities and stochastic events. For these reasons, the species is assessed as regionally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global range occurs in the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No known issues. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">140-216 cm, 9-15 kg. A huge, predominantly white pelican with a bulging yellow bill pouch and swollen knob-like forehead. Female smaller, with longer occipital crest and bright orange facial skin. White plumage of breeding bird tinged pink, with yellow patch on chest. Remiges black, contrasting with white coverts. Bare facial skin pinkish to orange. Bill grey-blue, turning orange-yellow distally, with red terminal nail. Eyes dark red. Legs pink; feet yellow. Non-breeders lack pink tinge and swollen knob on forehead; bare parts duller and skin around eye more yellow. Juvenile duller and mottled brown, with greyer bill and dark feet; plumage gradually whitens with age (Crawford 2005c).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Great White Pelican is widely distributed in Africa and parts of Eurasia (Crawford 2005c). The species is nomadic, moving vast distances in response to environmental conditions. In South Africa, breeding takes place at three localities, namely Vondeling and Dassen islands in Western Cape, and at Lake St Lucia in KwaZulu-Natal. All three sites are IBAs. Birds spread out from these breeding sites, extending up the West Coast of Western Cape, and in KwaZulu-Natal southward down the East Coast to Durban and northward into Mozambique. Non-breeding birds are found scattered at larger waterbodies in all other provinces (Williams and Borello 1997a). The species is a vagrant to Swaziland (Parker 1994). It is not known whether movement between the populations in Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal occurs; consequently, these have been treated as sub-populations.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 75 000 pairs, of which 80% breed in Africa (BirdLife International 2014bn). The regional population is estimated at c. 2 500 pairs or 5 000 mature individuals, of which c. 2 000 pairs occur in Kwa&#173;Zulu-Natal and the remaining c. 500 pairs in Western Cape (Crawford et al. 2012a). Confidence in this regional population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The overall global population trend is uncertain, as some populations are decreasing while others are increasing or stable (Dodman and Diagana 2006). Regular counts at Lake St Lucia since 2004 indicate that numbers can fluctuate from zero to greater than 8 000 adults (MB Bowker pers. obs). Crawford and Taylor (2000) estimated that the colony at Lake St Lucia was in the region of 3 000 pairs, which has decreased to c. 2 000 pairs (2012a). There is concern over the number of unsuccessful breeding attempts that have taken place over the past decade and the medium and long-term impacts that this may have on the structure of this sub-population. The Western Cape sub-population increased fourfold from a maximum count of 320 pairs in 1978 to 834 pairs in 2004 (Crawford et al. 2012a), before decreasing slightly to less than370 pairs in 2006. The population trend for the Western Cape sub-population is stable, but could be dramatically reversed with a change in farming practices. The overall regional population trend is downward. Confidence in this estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Great White Pelicans inhabit estuaries, lagoons, coastal bays, shallow lakes, floodplain pans and dams where they feed on fish and, at times, other seabirds (Kemper et al. 2007). Dry-land roosts in open areas are needed. These are typically islands, wide shorelines or peninsulas associated with the waterbodies where the birds feed (Crawford 2005c). They breed on islands or artificial platforms which are inaccessible to predators (Crawford et al. 2012a).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Fluctuating levels and salinity of Lake St Lucia, which impact on food productivity and availability of nest sites, are the biggest threats facing the KwaZulu-Natal sub-population (Bowker and Downs 2008a). Low influx of water from the catchments into the lake has resulted in low water levels and a resultant failure by the birds to initiate breeding (Bowker and Downs 2008b). In Western Cape, the breeding sites are more secure, but feeding on offal at farms is a major concern. There is potential for extreme fluctuations in food supply associated with this, and for introduction of avian pathogens (Crawford et al. 1995) that could have devastating consequences (de Ponte Machado 2007). It is uncertain how this change in foraging behaviour will affect the population or whether this food resource will remain available. Lesser threats include human disturbance at breeding colonies (Berry et al. 1973), pollution, particularly the ingestion of plastics (Crawford et al. 1995), collision with power-lines, as well as starvation and breeding failure during droughts.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">All breeding sites in the region have some form of protection. iSimangaliso Wetland Park (SA058) is a provincial nature reserve, Ramsar Site and World Heritage Site, while both Dassen and Vondeling islands are provincial nature reserves. Conservation measures include regular monitoring of population numbers and their breeding effort.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Conservation action in Western Cape needs to focus on the interaction between this species and the region's pig and chicken farmers, and the development of management plans. In KwaZulu-Natal, water abstraction from Lake St Lucia's catchments needs to be monitored and controlled. It is essential that measures are adopted that will ensure the retention of breeding islands in this system. Food sources available to pelicans also need to be monitored.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This regional population of Pink-backed Pelican Pelecanus rufescens numbers less than1 000 mature individuals, thus satisfying criterion D2 as regionally Vulnerable. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">135-15 cm, 4.9-6 kg. Sexes alike in plumage colouration. Smaller and greyer than Great White Pelican P. onocrotalus, with greyer and less contrasting remiges; also differs in habit of perching regularly in trees. Crown pale grey with distinctive grey crest. Underparts pale, often faintly washed pink or yellow. Mantle, back and rump pale grey, with pinkish tinge (difficult to observe). Breast has stiff, lanceolate feathers. Tail greyish white. Bill yellow with yellow-red nail. Pouch deep yellow. Eye red or brown, surrounded by bare greyish to flesh-coloured skin. Legs and feet greyish pink to yellow. Bill and facial skin briefly become more flushed and colourful in pre-breeding period. Non-breeding birds are generally duller, have shorter crests and lack a pink tinge to plumage. Juvenile duller; initially mottled brown, with grey bill, greenish grey pouch, and pinkish grey feet (Ryan 2005k).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Pink-backed Pelican has a wide Afrotropical range and also extends to Arabia (Brown et al. 1982), the Seychelles (Stoddart 1977) and Madagascar (Langrand 1990). Two core populations exist in southern Africa: the wetlands of Caprivi, Namibia over to the Okavango-Chobe system in Botswana; and secondly, the coastal plain of southern Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal, south to Durban (Williams and Borello 1997b). Historically a colony existed at the mouth of the Hluhluwe River, Lake St Lucia but moved to nearby Nsumo Pan in Mkuze Game Reserve. The species has also bred at Richards Bay (1975-76) and Pongolapoort Dam, Pongola (1975, 1986) (Berruti 1980, Tarboton et al. 1987). Recently, a small colony has been established at Durban Botanical Gardens (Bowker et al. 2010). Birds undertake seasonal movements with CWAC counts indicating that Nsumo and Nyamithi pans are preferred in summer while Lake St Lucia is utilised in winter (Bowker et al. 2010). In addition, regional movements have been recorded with birds from Kwa&#173;Zulu-Natal moving north into Mozambique (Brooke 1981). Although Parker (1999) described the species as an uncommon visitor to southern Mozambique, up to 400 birds have been recorded at different sites in that country. Records from Northern Cape, North West and Gauteng provinces are attributed to birds originating from colonies in the Caprivi/Okavango area (Williams and Borello 1997b). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 50 000-100 000 birds (Dodman and Diagana 2006). A number of regional estimates have been provided although there are several problems related to obtaining accurate population estimates: the species is long-lived, undertakes seasonal as well as regional movements, and breeds asynchronously (Burke and Brown 1970) with the breeding season lasting more than six months. Williams and Borello (1997b) provide an estimate of 250 pairs while Taylor (2000) placed the regional population at 240-300 birds. Estimates of total numbers during summer counts varied from 34 birds (1999) to 250 (2003) with an average of 122 ± 69 (n=14); winter totals ranged from 46 (2003) to 168 (1998) with an average of 82 ± 40 (n=14) (Bowker et al. 2010). More recent counts conducted in October 2004, January 2005 and July 2005 in KwaZulu-Natal produced totals of 46, 628 and 159 (average 278) birds respectively (Bowker et al. 2010), demonstrating the occurrence of extreme fluctuations that take place. Monthly aerial counts for Lake St Lucia, Nsumo and Muzi pans ranged from zero to a maximum of 622 birds (Bowker et al. 2010). In 2010, a colony was reported from at Nyamithi Pan, Ndumo Game Reserve, with no apparent reductions in the size of the nearby Nsumo colony pointing to an apparent increase in the regional population. Based upon this, a regional population of 600-900 mature individuals is estimated (Bowker et al. 2010). However, taking into account that this species is extremely mobile and that numbers fluctuate greatly, the confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is perceived to be stable in the absence of any observed declines or substantial threats (BirdLife International 2014bo). The regional population is likewise considered to be stable, or increasing. Confidence in this trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The onset of rains in December-January, which results in flooding around the base of trees used for breeding, triggers the reproductive cycle (Williams and Borello 1997b). Birds are predominantly monogamous but it is unknown if pair bonds are retained throughout the year (Din and Eltringham 1974). Favoured trees are often killed by guano deposits (Din and Eltringham 1974). A generation length of 15.4 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014bo). Pink-backed Pelicans forage in a wide range of wetlands, both fresh and saline, including bays, lagoons, estuaries, lakes, dams and rivers (Williams and Borello 1997b). Birds loaf on the shoreline and roost in trees (Din and Eltringham 1974).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Three sites are of extreme importance to the regional Pink-backed Pelican population, namely Nsumo and Nyamithi pans for breeding purposes in summer, as well as Lake St Lucia for foraging in winter (Bowker et al. 2010). Major threats to the species would be linked to any form of disturbance at these sites. Changes to the natural flooding regimes of pans in the Pongola River Floodplain and the loss of other habitat continually threatens the survival of the species in the region. Colonial nest sites are usually established in tall trees at large waterbodies, in areas that are free from human disturbance. The present sites are in protected areas. However, the birds change sites as the trees in which the nests are built become unsuitable after a few years (Bowker and Downs 2008c). Elephants Loxodonta africana also impact on these trees, and the demand for many large and suitable trees around these waterbodies is a potentially limiting factor. As in other piscivores, pelicans are prone to accumulation of toxins in their body tissues, which may impact upon reproductive success.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species has been the subject of research for the past eight years, and monitoring of breeding colonies continues. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Monitoring of the breeding colony should continue to ascertain trends in population numbers. The small number of breeding sites make the species susceptible to natural catastrophes and breeding failure. Pink-backed Pelicans have attempted to breed in heronries outside of their normal range, and the possibility of enticing the establishment of such additional breeding sites, through planting or modifying of suitable nesting trees, or provisioning of artificial nesting platforms should be investigated (Taylor 2000e). Potential sites for such initiatives may include Kruger National Park, Vaal Dam and Barberspan Bird Sanctuary. Otherwise, conservation efforts should focus on maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems and minimising disturbance at breeding colonies. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Grey Petrel Procellaria cinerea breeds at two locations in the region namely Prince Edward Island and Marion Island. The species is suspected to have met the criterion for regionally Vulnerable after undergoing declines of greater than 30% over a three generation period.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Grey Petrel is globally Near Threatened and breeds on the Prince Edward Islands. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Formerly placed in the monospecific genus Adamastor but now included in Procellaria. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">50 cm, 1 kg. Sexes alike. A medium-large grey petrel with contrasting white underparts. Above, including upperwing coverts, silvery grey with a slightly paler neck. Grey cap extends below eye. Flight feathers and primary coverts grey-brown. Underwing and undertail medium grey. Underparts white. Bill creamy or yellowish horn with darker tip. Eyes dark brown. Legs and feet grey (Ryan 2005t).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Grey Petrel has a circumpolar distribution in Subantarctic and subtropical waters, mostly between 37°S and 49°S but extending further north in the Humboldt Current to about 18°S off the east coast of South America (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It breeds on a several South African, French, New Zealand and Australian Subantarctic islands, as well as on Amsterdam Island, and in the Gough and Tristan de Cunha group (Brooke 2004). The species also breeds on both Prince Edward and Marion islands (the reason for its inclusion here). It is a rare non-breeding vagrant to continental South African waters, generally remaining in the Southern Ocean for the majority of the year and seldom venturing north of the Subtropical Convergence (Ryan and Bester 2008).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Global population data are scarce and accurate census data for most breeding sites are currently lacking (Garnett et al. 2011). The core of the global population occurs on the Antipodes Islands which support 53 000 pairs (Bell 2002), followed by 10 000 pairs on Gough Island (Brooke 2004). Crozet, Kerguelen, Amsterdam, Campbell and Tristan islands hold much smaller populations. The global population is estimated at c. 400 000 individuals (Garnett et al. 2011). Burrow-nesting species are challenging to census accurately, so there is very little information on population trends. Ryan and Bester (2008) provide estimates of 2 000 mature individuals on Marion Island and 10 000 mature individuals breeding on Prince Edward Island, giving a regional population estimate of 12 000 mature individuals. Confidence in this estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Confidence in the global population trend is low (BirdLife International 2014bq) but moderately rapid declines are suspected. The rate of decline of the regional population is  suspected to be greater than 30% over three generations (75 years) but further data are urgently required in order to more accurately assess its population numbers and trends (Garnett et al. 2011). Confidence in this trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Grey Petrel is a burrow-nesting, colonial, winter breeder (Cooper and Brown 1990). 93% of successful breeding birds return the following season (Chastel 1995). It lays a single egg, which is not replaced if the breeding attempt fails (Warham 1990). A generation length of 25.2 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014bq). The foraging methods of Grey Petrel are poorly known (Ridoux 1994) but it is thought to feed predominantly by surface-seizing. Analysis of stomach contents of chicks shows that the species feeds primarily on squid (70.5%) and fish (27.8%) (Ridoux 1994). The species is attracted to trawlers and other fishing vessels (Ryan and Rose 1989).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to the global population is incidental mortality caused by commercial longline fisheries (Huyser 2000c). The species is the most commonly caught seabird in New Zealand fisheries and Barbraud et al. (2009) reported declines due to fishery bycatch at the Kerguelen Islands. Regionally, relatively few were killed on toothfish longlines around the Prince Edward Islands (Nel et al. 2002c). The species is susceptible to introduced mammalian predators with populations on Gough Island being thought to have been subjected to considerable predation from introduced mice (Wanless et al. 2007) and the extirpation of the species on Macquarie Island being attributed to cats and rats. There is concern about the possible impact of mice at Marion Island. Prior to eradication in the early 1990s, feral cats on Marion Island predated upon this species (van Aarde 1980). There are no accurate data to monitor the recovery of burrowing petrel populations at Marion Island (Ryan and Bester 2008) but it is thought that the Grey Petrel, a winter breeder, came under extreme pressure from predation by cats.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Grey Petrel is protected internationally under the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels - Annex 1. The species is currently listed as globally Near Threatened, and is included in Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013. A feasibility study for eradication plans to rid Marion Island of mice is currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Public awareness regarding the conservation needs of large petrels should be increased. Mitigation strategies to reduce accidental bycatch for fisheries must be maintained.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population of the Macaroni Penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus breeding at the Prince Edward Islands was assessed as regionally Vulnerable, having satisfied Criterion A2 with a decrease of 30%, the causes of which may not have ceased, are not fully understood and may not be reversible. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was listed as Near Threatened in the 2000 regional assessment and globally Vulnerable in 2013.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Royal Penguin E. schlegeli, which is found in the south-west Pacific Ocean and breeds on Macquarie Island, was previously treated as a subspecies of the Macaroni Penguin, with plumage differences considered to represent polymorphism. The two taxa are similar, differing mainly in the amount of blue-black feathering on their cheeks and throat: whereas these feathers are dark in chrysolophus, they are white or pale grey in schlegeli, which also exhibits yellow-tinged feathers between the bill and eye. There are also biometric differences between these two penguins (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Macaroni Penguins have paired and hybridised with Southern Rockhopper Penguins E. chrysocome on the Falkland Islands (White and Clausen 2002). The Macaroni Penguin is monotypic (del Hoyo et al. 1992).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">71 cm; 5-6 kg. A fairly large penguin with filamentous yellow, crest-like plumes on forehead typical of Eudyptes. Sexes alike. Upperparts and throat blue-black. Underparts white. Flippers black dorsally, with thin white trailing edge; ventrally white, with black tip and black basal leading edge. Long feather plumes extend from forehead along sides of head to meet above eyes, forming broad, loose crest. Obvious gape distinctly pink, fleshy and angled. Bill larger in males; red-brown. Eyes dull red. Legs and feet pink. Juvenile similar except for greyer eyes, grey tones on chin and throat and lack of distinct crest feathers (Marchant and Higgins 1990).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Macaroni Penguin has a more southerly distribution than most other crested penguins, breeding between about latitudes 45°S and 65°S in the western Indian Ocean (on Heard and McDonald, Kerguelen, Crozet and Prince Edward islands groups) and the South Atlantic Ocean (Bouvet, South Sandwich, South Georgia, South Orkney, South Shetland and Falkland islands, and in small numbers at islands off the Antarctic Peninsula) (Poncet 1993). It also extends into the south-east Pacific along the coast of southern Chile. The largest colonies are north of 55°S (Marchant and Higgins 1990).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 6.3 million breeding pairs in at least 258 colonies at c. 55 breeding sites (Crossin et al. 2013), with key populations on Isles Crozet (2.2 million pairs, including 1 million on Ilots des Pingouins), Kerguelen (1.8 million pairs), Heard Island (1 million pairs), South Georgia (1 million pairs) and Marion Island. In 2012/13, it was estimated that 266 971 pairs of Macaroni Penguins bred at Marion, compared to 433 723 pairs in 1994/95 (Crawford et al. 2003d, 2009c). A linear regression fitted to the data suggests that the population in 2012/13 was 278 000 pairs. An estimated 12 000 pairs bred at Prince Edward Island in 2008/09 (Crawford et al. 2009c). The overall population at the Prince Edward Islands is estimated at 279 000-290 000 pairs. Confidence in this estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The current global population estimate of 6.3 million breeding pairs (Crossin et al. 2013) represents a 30% reduction on the previous estimate of 9 million pairs (Woehler and Croxall 1997). It was estimated that there were 449 892 pairs of Macaroni Penguins on Marion Island in 1974-1977 (Siegfried et al. 1978), based on counts of small colonies and at two large colonies (Bullard Beach and Kildalkey Bay), measurements of areas occupied and densities of nests, or 1974-1977 counts of moulting birds made from aerial photographs. 405 084 pairs were present in the 1983/84 breeding season (Watkins 1987) and 433 723 pairs in 1994/95 (Crawford et al. 2003d).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> It was then estimated that by 2008/09 numbers breeding had decreased by 32% (Crawford et al. 2009c). By 2008/09, there were significant decreases in numbers breeding at the small colonies and at both of the large colonies, where densities of nests also decreased significantly (Crawford et al. 2009c). In 2012/13, 266 971 pairs bred at Marion Island. Therefore, between 1976/77 and 2012/13, a period of 36 years, estimates of the numbers breeding decreased by 41%. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Numbers breeding at Marion Island were available for each season between 1994/95 and 2012/13 (Crawford et al. 2003d, 2009c). In this period, the estimated population in 1994/95 was 416 000 pairs and that in 2012/13 was 278 000 pairs. This is equivalent to a decrease of 33% in 19 years. Confidence in this trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">During October, Macaroni Penguins return to breed at Marion Island, in colonies which range from small numbers of birds to the two large colonies that presently each hold greater than 100 000 pairs and formerly held greater than 200 000 pairs (Crawford et al. 2003d, 2009c). Breeding areas usually have little or no vegetation due to erosion by birds. Traditional paths are used to access colonies (BM Dyer pers. obs.). At Marion Island, Macaroni Penguins mostly breed for the first time when four years old (Crawford et al. 2003d). Males arrive for breeding several days earlier than females. Both sexes undertake substantial fasts during courtship and breeding (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Pairs lay two eggs from late October to mid November, but only the larger second eggs produce fledged chicks, which leave the island by the end of February (Crawford et al. 2003d). Incubation takes 34-39 days (Williams 1981). After breeding, Macaroni Penguins go to sea to fatten for about a month before returning to islands to moult, when they remain ashore for 20-30 days to replace all their feathers (Williams 1981). They then depart to over-wintering grounds to regain condition. At Marion Island, Macaroni Penguins feed mainly on crustaceans (euphausiids and amphipods), fish (mostly myctophids) and cephalopods (Brown and Klages 1987) with composition of prey changing as chicks develop. The median trip duration of adults provisioning chicks was 22.8 hours and most dives were less than10 m (Pichegru et al. 2011).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Inadequate breeding success has been a factor in the decrease of Macaroni Penguins at Marion Island (Crawford et al. 2003d). Overwintering conditions are thought to influence the proportions of Macaroni Penguins skipping breeding, and therefore population-level breeding success; feeding conditions during breeding also may influence breeding success (Crawford et al. 2006). Global climate change may have altered the availability of prey to Macaroni Penguins (Crawford et al. 2003d). In winter, Macaroni Penguins from Marion Island forage mostly to the south of the island, sometimes approaching the edge of the sea-ice (J-B Thiebot et al. unpubl. data). No fisheries currently target the main prey of Macaroni Penguins at the Prince Edward Islands, but should the fishery industry be introduced this would potentially decrease prey availability (BirdLife International 2014bp). Longline fisheries at winter feeding grounds have inflicted limited incidental mortality on Macaroni Penguins (BM Dyer unpubl. data). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Recoveries of numbers of fur seals Arctocephalus spp. at the Prince Edward Islands (Hofmeyr et al. 2006, Bester et al. 2009) could increase competition for prey and lead to increased predation of Macaroni and other penguins by seals. Increasing seal herds could also block access to penguin breeding sites, thereby inhibiting colony growth, as happened at Bouvet Island (Isaksen et al. 1997). Giant petrels Macronectes spp., Subantarctic Skuas Stercorarius antarcticus and Lesser Sheathbills Chionis minor also inflict mortality (BM Dyer pers. obs.). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Macaroni Penguins are susceptible to outbreaks of disease, including avian cholera Pasteurella multocida; disease outbreaks killed substantial numbers of Macaroni Penguins at Marion Island in 1992, 1993 and 2004 (Cooper et al. 2009). Oil spills around breeding colonies could be catastrophic.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Macaroni Penguins breeding at the Prince Edward Islands are indirectly protected, along with all other seabirds on the islands, by a number of regulations. For example, at Marion Island, there are strict guidelines in place for offloading diesel. Poultry products supplied to the over-wintering teams at Marion Island, or used during relief voyages to the island, do not contain bones and are irradiated in order to reduce the risk of introducing avian diseases. A contingency plan is in place to guide responses to outbreaks of disease at the Prince Edward Islands. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No access is allowed to Prince Edward Island itself, except for bona fide research and conservation purposes every 4-5 years. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Monitoring of population numbers and demographic, diet and condition parameters at Marion Island should be continued. A population census at Prince Edward Island should be undertaken at intervals of about five years. Best-practice guidelines for reducing risk of disease outbreaks at islands are being developed by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels. Once available, these guidelines should replace those presently operating at the Prince Edward Islands. Overwintering teams should be given basic training in the rescue and rehabilitation of oiled penguins. The impact of any proposed fishery on the prey of Macaroni Penguins should be carefully assessed before such a fishery is allowed. Consideration should be given to declaring marine protected areas at important feeding grounds of Macaroni Penguins.</p>

</div>

<div id="_idContainer938" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Spectacled Petrel Procellaria conspicillata is listed as globally Vulnerable due to significant numbers being caught as bycatch in longline fisheries. Owing to its very small breeding range, it is highly susceptible to stochastic events and human activities. The species occurs in South African territorial waters and the global status is retained as the regional status. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species does not breed in the region but occurs in unknown numbers within 200 nm of South Africa. In addition, it is classified as globally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Formerly considered a subspecies of White-chinned Petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis, but it differs consistently in terms of phenotype (Ryan 1998) and genotype (Techow et al. 2009), and is now generally accepted to be a monotypic species. </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">50-58 cm, 1.2 kg. Sexes alike but male slightly larger. A large, blackish brown petrel, superficially similar to the closely-related White-chinned Petrel but with a dusky bill tip and diagnostic white bands encircling its eyes at all ages; these ‘spectacles' meet on the forehead, forming a distinctive white blaze when viewed from head on. The extent of the spectacles vary considerably among individuals, and are reduced to a few white feathers in extreme cases. Bill creamy horn with a dark tip. Eyes dark. Legs and feet blackish brown (Ryan and Andrew 2007).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Confined as a breeding species to Inaccessible Island, one of the islands in the Tristan da Cunha archipelago, in the central South Atlantic Ocean (Camphuysen and van der Meer 2000). Disperses widely between 22-46°S in the South Atlantic, mainly 25-40°S (Enticott and O Connell 1985, Camphuysen and van der Meer 2000, Bugoni et al. 2009). A rare visitor to the south-west Indian Ocean (Ryan 2005v), but some recent sightings from around Amsterdam Island (Shirihai and Kirwan 2008) may indicate a relict population in the Indian Ocean (Ryan 1998). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the Spectacled Petrel was estimated to be 14 400 breeding pairs in 2009/10 (Ryan and Ronconi 2011). Given the ongoing population increase over the last decade of roughly 7% per year, this probably now exceeds 15 000 pairs, which equates to a total population of some 60 000 mature individuals. The proportion of the population entering South African waters is probably relatively small, given the relative scarcity of sightings off the South African coast (Ryan 2005v), but there is limited observer coverage of the warmer, oceanic waters off the West Coast favoured by this species. In addition, it is easily overlooked among the abundant White-chinned Petrel. Two of eight adults tracked with satellite tags from Inaccessible Island visited South African waters during summer (Reid et al. 2014). The confidence in this estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population on Inaccessible Island was estimated to be only a few tens of pairs in 1937 (Hagen 1952), a few hundred pairs in 1950 (Rowan et al. 1951) and about 1 000 pairs in 1982/1983 (Fraser et al. 1988). Standardised five-yearly surveys commenced in 1999, with the population increasing from some 5 900-7 000 pairs in 1999 to 8 500-10 100 pairs in 2004 and 12 800-14 400 in 2009 (Ryan and Moloney 2000, Ryan et al. 2006, Ryan and Ronconi 2011). The confidence in these trend estimates is high.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At sea, favours relatively warm water with low chlorophyll concentrations (Bugoni et al. 2009, Reid et al. 2014). Regularly follows ships; sometimes caught on fishing gear, but appears less susceptible to longline bycatch than White-chinned Petrel. Diet is poorly known; feeds on cephalopods, decapod crustaceans and small fish (Hagen 1952). Breeds singly or in loose colonies on the plateau of Inaccessible Island. Colonies in Blechnum palmiforme heath create distinctive Scirpus spp. bog areas (Ryan and Andrew 2007). Present in colonies mainly September to March, but some also visit the island in winter (Rowan et al. 1951). Egg-laying occurs in October, chicks hatching in December and fledging in March (Ryan and Andrew 2007). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The main threat is accidental mortality on fishing gear, especially longlines. Rarely caught on longlines off South Africa (only one confirmed record, caught on a tuna longliner), but regularly caught off the east coast of South America (Bugoni et al. 2008). Apparently driven close to extinction by introduced pigs on Inaccessible Island, but recovered since pigs died out around the turn of the 20th century (Fraser et al. 1988, Ryan et al. 2006). Despite ongoing mortality on longlines, surveys in 1999, 2004 and 2009 showed increases of 7% per year (Ryan and Moloney 2000, Ryan et al. 2006, Ryan and Ronconi 2011). Consequently the species was downlisted from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable in 2007. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Listed on the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Appendix II) and ACAP Annexure 1. Inaccessible Island forms part of the Gough-Inaccessible Island Natural World Heritage Site. The island's wetlands, including the bogs formed by Spectacled Petrel colonies, are also listed as Ramsar sites. Access to the island is restricted to research visits and supervised day-visits by tourist groups to the coastal zone. Tristan Islanders retain the right to collect driftwood and guano (Ryan and Glass 2001). BirdLife's Albatross Task Force and other NGOs work with the commercial fishing industry to monitor and reduce bycatch rates, especially in fisheries off South America.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Promote adoption of best-practice mitigation measures in South African fisheries and those operating in international waters through Regional Fishery Management Organisations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna and the South East Atlantic Fishery Organisation. Conduct regular surveys of the breeding population, and ensure that strict measures are in place to prevent introduction of mammalian predators.</p>

	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-chinned Petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis and the superficially similar Spectacled Petrel P. conspicillata were previously considered conspecific, but were recently split based on differences in plumage, wing length and vocalisations (Ryan 1998, Brooke 2004). The former species is generally considered monotypic, but recent genetic work has suggested that sub-populations breeding in New Zealand form a distinct clade, possibly at the subspecies-level (Techow et al. 2009). Only the nominate form has been recorded from southern Africa. Tracking, genetic and stable isotope data all suggest that the waters off southern Africa primarily host birds from the south-western Indian Ocean colonies (Prince Edward Islands, Crozets and Kerguelen). </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">50-58 cm, 1.2-1.4 kg. Sexes alike in plumage, but differ in size and bill depth. A relatively large petrel with all-dark plumage except for variable amount of white on chin. Occasional variants have white spots on the head, sides of the face, belly or wings. Bill grey-white in juvenile, becoming ivory in older birds. Flight feathers are shinier and, in contrast to the coverts, can appear silvery. Eye dark brown. Legs and feet blackish grey, often with paler bases to webs. Confusion with Spectacled Petrel is possible, but the diagnostic features for the latter are its white forehead, usually complete circles around the eyes and a dark maxillary unguis (Ryan 2005m).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species has a wide distribution across all the Southern Ocean (Croxall et al. 1984), occurring from the pack-ice of Antarctica northwards to 20°S. It breeds on the French, New Zealand and South African Subantarctic islands, as well as on South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur) and the Falklands (Islas Malvinas) (BirdLife International 2014br). Within the region, it breeds on two islands namely Marion (290 km2) and Prince Edward (44 km2). Birds wintering off the coast of South Africa represent sub-populations from Crozet, Kerguelen and the Prince Edward Islands (Barquete 2012).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at c. 3 million mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014br) while Ryan et al. (2012) estimated the global population of the nominate form to be c. 1.1 million pairs. Compared to surface-nesting species such as albatrosses and giant petrels, the world population is poorly known (Ryan et al. 2012). Within the region, a comprehensive assessment of the breeding sub-population at the Prince Edward Islands estimated there to be 21 800-26 000 pairs at Marion and 9 000-15 000 pairs at Prince Edward, giving an estimate of 40 000 (33 000-50 000) pairs in the region (Ryan et al. 2012). The confidence in this estimate is moderate to low.</p>
	<h2>Trend justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Trend analysis of the global population from 1980-2054 (three generations, 74 years) predicts a 45% decline based on data from South Georgia and the Crozets (BirdLife International 2014br). Population monitoring on Marion Island between 1996-1997 and 1999-2000 recorded a 14.5% per year decrease in the population (Nel et al. 2002a) while data from at-sea surveys suggest a 35% decline in the southern Indian Ocean during 1981-2007 (Péron et al. 2010). However, if the ongoing decreases of the largest colony are used, and colonies for which there is no data are assumed to be stable, the global population could decrease by greater than 50% over three generations. Unfortunately, the true rate of decline of the regional population is unknown and the confidence in this trend estimate is moderate to low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The White-chinned Petrel is a colonial nesting species that breeds on an annual basis with the breeding season extending from October to May (Jouventin et al. 1985). It forages day and night, feeding mainly by surface-seizing, but is also capable of diving to depths of approximately 13 m (Huin 1994). The diet in South African continental waters comprises mainly of offal from trawlers, small fish, mantis shrimps Squilla armata, cuttlefish Sepia spp. and other cephalopods (Jackson 1988). The species is strongly attracted to trawlers and fishing vessels and regularly follows ships. A generation length of 24.7 years was calculated based on a published estimate of mean age at first breeding and a published estimate of mean annual survival (BirdLife International 2014br).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">White-chinned Petrels are attracted to ships and their ability to dive as well as their tendency to forage by day and night makes them highly vulnerable to accidental death in longline fisheries (Cherel et al. 1996). An estimated 45 000 per year were killed by longlines in the Southern Ocean Patagonian toothfish fishery, while 8 000 per year were caught off South Africa during the early 1990s at the start of the longline hake fisheries (Barnes et al. 1997). Bycatch in this fishery has decreased substantially since then (Petersen et al. 2009a). It is the seabird killed most frequently by the pelagic longline fishery targeting tuna spp. and Swordfish Xiphias gladius off South Africa, comprising around 70% of bycatch birds each year (Petersen et al. 2009a). On its breeding sites at the Prince Edward Islands, there are no major threats although the possibility that mice may prey upon chicks cannot be excluded and ongoing monitoring needs to take place (Jones and Ryan 2010). Introduced rats impact populations at some other breeding islands (e.g. Possession Island, Crozets).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">BirdLife South Africa's Albatross Task Force is actively researching new technologies to reduce incidental mortality in fisheries, as well as monitoring observer data and estimating annual bycatch in selected fisheries. It promotes the development and enforcement of best-practice to reduce incidental mortality as well as supporting the construction and distribution of devices such as bird scaring lines for fishing vessels. BirdLife International is actively lobbying Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, particularly the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, to improve the conservation measures required of longline fishing vessels. It is also supporting moves to create regional observer programmes, and strengthen observer data collection and reporting procedures. The species is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Publication of Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch on Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (2008). The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ongoing measures by BirdLife South Africa and BirdLife International, to improve pelagic longline fishing operations and reduce incidental mortality of seabirds should be supported and extended to distant water fishing nations operating in the Southern Ocean. The South African Government should promote international best-practice for reducing seabird mortalities at fora such as the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. Regional and national observer programmes and reporting of their data remain of paramount importance in understanding the scale of incidental mortality and potential effectiveness of (and level of compliance with) mitigation measures employed. Programmes to repeat the breeding census in a few years' time (possibly through a sub-sampling approach), and tracking birds to assess degree of overlap with various fisheries, remain important tools for assessing and addressing the ongoing threats from fishery interactions.</p>

	<h3>Research priorities and questions</h3>

Currently tracking studies are lacking, but evidence from other sources (Barquete 2012) suggests that appreciable numbers migrate to South African continental waters when not breeding and are vulnerable to longline fishing there. The dispersal patterns, proportional to the population, by sex, age-class and year, and therefore the risks posed to them at each stratum by different fisheries, needs to be quantified. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional Area of Occupancy of Short-tailed Pipit Anthus brachyurus is estimated at 1 185-2000 km2. In addition, its range is severely fragmented, satisfying criterion B2a for classification as regionally Vulnerable. The regional population may be 3 000-5 000 individuals, although the species is so poorly known that estimation of even basic population statistics is very challenging. Given the ongoing deterioration and irreversible alteration of grasslands, the species may undergo a decline of 10% within the next 10 years (C1). For these reasons the Short-tailed Pipit is classified as regionally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this species occurs within the region. In addition, the species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Several subspecies have been described (see Clancey 1990), but most authorities recognise only two: the nominate, apparently isolated brachyurus from southern Africa, and leggei further north in the Afrotropics. Alternatively, populations in Central Africa are sometimes included under eludens. Genetic analysis, supported by morphological, vocal and ecological evidence, suggests that the Short-tailed Pipit and Bushveld Pipit A. caffer form a species-pair, the latter replacing the Short-tailed Pipit in wooded habitats. These two species and the East African Sokoke Pipit A. sokokensis, together constitute a clade of small-bodied Afrotropical pipits separate from congeners (Voelker 1999). The alternative generic or sub-generic name Caffranthus has been suggested for the Short-tailed and related pipits.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">12-13 cm. A diminutive, compact grassland pipit. Basic impression is of a tiny, chunky bird with a plain face, heavy streaking above and below, and a short white-sided tail that is not wagged up and down. In flight, tail looks short and narrow with conspicuous white outer panels, and wings appear broad-based and triangular. Throat whitish, often with dark speckling concentrated along malar stripe and in sub-moustachial band. Breast off-white in centre, washed pale buff at sides or with faint citrine-yellow tinge. Flanks usually with buffy wash continuous with sides of breast. Belly and undertail coverts buffy white to greyish white. Breast profusely streaked with broad blackish brown streaks that become sharper and narrower on flanks. Crown, mantle, rump and uppertail coverts medium grey-brown, often with an olive-green or yellowish cast when fresh, streaked or mottled darker. Outer web of outer tail feather, and tips of outer and second tail feathers white. Remiges dark with grey-brown edges; tertials, greater coverts and median coverts with paler tips. Eye brown. Legs short; pink. Claws short and strongly curved; hind-claw 6-7 mm. Base of lower mandible pink (Clancey 1990, Keith et al. 1992, Peacock 2006).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Short-tailed Pipit is restricted to south-central and southern Africa. The bulk of the global distribution occurs in a band stretching from Gabon, through Congo and southwards over much of western and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo to eastern Angola and Zambia. An isolated population occurs in the grasslands of Uganda and possibly in adjacent Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. Within the region, the species is sparsely distributed in mesic grasslands of Mpumalanga, the south-eastern Free State and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, from sea-level to approximately 1 850 masl. SABAP data and unpublished reports suggest that its range is not only restricted, but also very fragmented: the extent of our knowledge of the distribution of the species is limited to a scattering of disparate records, which makes it difficult to infer meaningful patterns. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">However, being small, inconspicuous and cryptic in appearance, the Short-tailed Pipit is remarkably unobtrusive; in addition, its vocalisations are poorly known and not particularly arresting, and aerial display flights are often performed pre-dawn. Consequently, the species is widely overlooked, and it is almost certainly far more widespread than current data suggest. This is evidenced by recent discoveries of breeding populations in areas where it was believed to have become locally extinct, such as Mkambati Nature Reserve in Eastern Cape and the eastern outskirts of Gauteng; indeed, a localised but apparently thriving breeding population is now documented in the latter region.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In South Africa, it is known or suspected to occur in the vicinity of Wakkerstroom, Carolina, Ermelo and Graskop (Mpumalanga), the Bronkhorstspruit area (Gauteng), Harrismith, Sterkfontein Dam and Golden Gate areas (Free State), the Drakensberg range of KwaZulu-Natal and various localities in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, for example Vernon Crookes Nature Reserve, Melmoth, Cedara, Ixopo, Donnybrook and, in winter, along the coastal plain, for example around Lake St Lucia, Ozabeni, Hluhluwe, Cape Vidal, Lake Sibaya and Kosi Bay (Peacock 2006). In Eastern Cape, it was recently recorded at Mkambati Nature Reserve and at Mpofu Game Reserve on Katberg Mountain, near Fort Beaufort. It is known to breed in Malolotja National Park in Swaziland (ED Marais pers. comm.). It may occur marginally in Lesotho. The species is not know from Zimbabwe, despite the presence of apparently suitable habitat in the Eastern Highlands of that country. However, it occurs widely in coastal grasslands in Mozambique and is described as locally common at Rio Savane, north of Beira (Clancey 1990); it has also recently been discovered at a number of sites south of the Save River in winter (ED Marais pers. comm.). It is possible that coastal lowlands in Mozambique may be a winter refuge for birds breeding in South Africa's uplands in summer (see Ecology).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The limited (but probably underestimated) range of the Short-tailed Pipit is reflected in the paucity of bird atlas data. It was recorded in only 10 Quarter Degree Grid Squares (QDSs) in SABAP1, and, at the time of writing, in 19 SABAP2 pentads. The regional EoO based on SABAP2 was calculated as 108 099 km2, while the AoO was estimated at 7 540 km2. Surprisingly, these figures represent increases from SABAP1 (of approximately 20% and 18%, respectively). However, this is unlikely to represent true range expansion, and is more likely an effect of increased observer awareness, and particularly the discovery of small previously overlooked populations. Furthermore, even within its already precariously small AoO, the area of habitat suitable for this species is likely much smaller still because of its strict ecological requirements. An inspection of satellite imagery suggests that approximately 20-40% of the surface area of each pentad represents remotely suitable habitat. This proportion rises to 70-90% in pristine pentads situated in the core of the Short-tailed Pipit's range, with a higher percentage of pristine natural habitat (e.g. in the Drakensberg). If an average of 55% of the surface area of each pentad is considered to constitute suitable habitat, and SABAP1 and SABAP2 data are combined, a rough estimate of the potential range amounts to 1 158 km2. In consideration of the fact that the species is almost certainly widely overlooked, a realistic upper limit may lie in the order of 2 000 km2, in agreement with the estimate of Barnes (2000m).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014bs). The limited distributional data and unobtrusive nature of this species make it virtually impossible to accurately estimate population numbers and trends. Furthermore, the species can occur at surprisingly high local densities in optimal habitats, e.g. Davies et al. (2003) reported up to five pairs in 40 ha in Vernon Crookes Nature Reserve. During breeding peaks, adjacent nests can occur at near-colonial densities, to the extent that some observers have questioned whether the species may employ a polygynous breeding system; for example, Davies and Christian (2008) recorded 6 nests in an area of approximately 6 ha, with the closest two active nests only 55 m apart. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Barnes (2000m) provided a preliminary regional population estimate of less than3 000 mature individuals, but this number may be an underestimate. Based on reports by Davies et al. (2003), that suggest local densities may be as high as 25 breeding adults/km2 and extrapolating this to the adapted AoO discussed above, the population may be in the order of 30 000-50 000 birds. However, in the absence of more extensive population density data, this estimate is dangerously speculative. Taking a more cautionary approach, especially considering seasonal fluctuations in the availability of suitable habitat, a total regional estimate of 3 000- 5 000 mature adults is advocated. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to be stable in the absence of any evidence of declines. Barnes (2000m) suggested a possible population decline of 10% in the past three generations and a possible future decline of up to 20% in the next three generations. It is not certain that these declines have taken place, and with the discovery of hitherto overlooked localities and increased observer awareness, both the EoO and AoO of this species have increased in SABAP2 data. However, given the continued destruction and degradation of its grassland habitat, the Short-tailed Pipit is likely to undergo at least moderate declines in the near future. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">During the breeding season, the Short-tailed Pipit's range is limited by a specific suite of ecological requirements. The species inhabits short, moist, open grassland, 10-20 cm high, with or without light woody cover (Davies and Christian 2008). It shows a strong preference for grasslands regenerating after winter burns, with coarse grass tufts and scattered wild flowers and small forbs, interspersed with open soil patches to allow for terrestrial foraging, mobility and visibility (Tarboton et al. 1987). Reportedly breeds from 300-1 850 m in KwaZulu-Natal (Davies et al. 2003). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Short-tailed Pipit's movements are poorly known, with current evidence suggesting a partial exodus from higher grasslands to coastal areas after breeding. In lower altitude subtropical or coastal grasslands it may be found in moist, short, tussocky grassland often in the general vicinity of water such as along margins of pans and dambos, on floodplains, or in depressions (Mendelsohn et al. 1988). However, the species may be resident in some areas, or undergo nomadic dispersion, depending on fires, rainfall and environmental conditions. The diet is little known, but the species is likely to be primarily insectivorous. Breeding occurs in green, tussocky grassland regenerating from winter burns in October to February, peaking in November.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As is the case with many other range-restricted grassland species, the Short-tailed Pipit is threatened by historic, ongoing and predicted habitat alteration and degradation (Peacock 2006). Some local habitat losses, and therefore population reductions or local extinctions, can be attributed to over- or undergrazing by domestic livestock and the resultant changes in plant species composition, habitat structure, prey availability and breeding success. These impacts are compounded by unfavourable fire regimes, although some localised burning during the non-breeding season may be beneficial, or indeed essential, to the species (Davies and Christian 2008). Further threats related to habitat loss include open-cast coal mining, commercial afforestation, and agricultural expansion. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No dedicated conservation or research efforts focused on this species are currently underway. As stated by Barnes (2000a), research on the species' ecological requirements, and on land-management practices and their effects on the Short-tailed Pipit, is urgently required. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Pending the results of proposed research questions outlined here, conservation measures should focus on maintaining suitable breeding habitat, focusing particularly on suitable grazing pressure and frequency and timing of burns. Species-specific management practices in grasslands, both on privately- and state-owned properties, as well as in existing conservation areas, could prove very beneficial.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the endemic Yellow-breasted Pipit Anthus chloris satisfies the criteria for regionally Vulnerable in that atlas data suggest a population size reduction of greater than 30% may have occurred over the past 10 years, based on a decline in Extent of Occurrence, Area of Occupancy and the quality of the remaining sensitive upland grassland habitat to which this species is restricted. This reduction and its causes are not likely to have ceased; indeed, based upon continuing threats to the Grassland Biome, the rate of decline is expected to increase and become more rapid in future. In addition, the Yellow-breasted Pipit's regional (and global) population size is estimated to number less than10 000 mature individuals.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Yellow-breasted Pipit is endemic to the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in the 2000 regional assessment and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Roberts (1922) proposed a new genus Hemimacronyx, in view of the Yellow-breasted Pipit's many peculiarities, some of which are more reminiscent of the related longclaws Macronyx spp. However, this proposal is not widely accepted. A genetic analysis is currently underway, which may elucidate the position of this taxon. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">16-18 cm, 25 g. A unique, brightly coloured pipit of high-lying grasslands. Adults show slight dimorphism in colour in the breeding season (the female having a more buffy and less streaked breast), but the sexes are similar in size. The only pipit in the region with a yellow throat and breast. Unmistakable in breeding plumage, with bright lemon-yellow underparts; central belly and vent paler. Dorsally, grey brown with distinct scaling formed by pale edges to dark mantle feathers. Axillaries and most of underwing coverts bright yellow, greater underwing coverts black with white tips. Outermost rectrices mostly white. Legs and feet yellowish pink to pinkish. Hind-claw long. Bill dark horn with a variable greyish or orange-yellow base to lower mandible. Non-breeding birds are duller in colouration, lacking the diagnostic yellow underparts, and are consequently probably widely overlooked; such birds still retain a yellow spot on the central belly and yellow underwing coverts. Juvenile similar to non-breeding adult, but shows a yellowish wash below (Keith et al. 1992, Peacock 2006).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Almost exclusively endemic to South Africa's upland grasslands, with an estimated distribution range of less than3 000 km2 (Barnes 2000n). The Lesotho population, while previously more extensive, is now limited to Sehlabathebe National Park (Osborne and Tigar 1990), due to excessive grazing and burning of unconserved areas. However, recent sight records in that country may suggest that the species is more widespread. It occurs marginally in Swaziland: although the population there is little known, the species appears to be restricted to high-lying grasslands in the west of the country. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In South Africa, the core distribution of the Yellow-breasted Pipit extends in a narrow strip northwards from about Matatiele, KwaZulu-Natal along the eastern slopes of the main escarpment in the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park. From there the species extends northwards along Free State's eastern border where it is found in the Warden, Vredefort, Memel, Leeuwspruit and Golden Gate areas, and near Harrismith on inselbergs such as Platberg. It reaches its northernmost limits in Mpumalanga, where it is known from the Wakkerstroom area and Steenkampsberg range around Dullstroom in the north.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Populations in the northern, interior parts of Eastern Cape appear (notwithstanding limited atlasing effort) to have contracted, and the remaining population of the Yellow-breasted Pipit in this province is very limited, presumably due to intensive grazing and burning and habitat transformation. However, it is suspected that isolated populations persist in this region (Barnes 2000n), as evidenced by a few SABAP2 records south to about Cathcart. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The non-breeding distribution, although poorly known, appears to be larger with birds migrating to lower altitudes both east and west of their high-altitude breeding grounds. Isolated records have been obtained in the central Highveld grasslands in the west (including from Secunda in Mpumalanga, and several records from Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve, Gauteng) and the coastal grasslands of KwaZulu Natal in the east (Peacock 2006). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Overall, the EoO (95 182 km2) has decreased by 38.3% since SABAP1, while the AoO has decreased by 55% to 13 576 km2. However, given the Yellow-breasted Pipit's specialised habitat requirements, it probably occupies less than10% of this area, which prompted Barnes (2000o) to suggest its actual AoO may be closer to 3 000 km2. Applying the same assumption to the SABAP2 estimates, the effective AoO may be as small as c. 1 360 km2. This figure seems likely in light of the substantial decreases between the two atlas periods.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional (and global) population was quantified at 2 500-6 000 birds by Barnes (2000o), roughly equivalent to 1 700-4 300 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014cb). A coarse earlier estimate by Siegfried (1992) suggested that 1 500-5 000 individuals remain. Given the apparently substantial decreases in range that this species has experienced since Barnes' 2000 assessment (see Trend Justification), and assuming a concomitant population decrease, the total may now be considerably smaller; based on a relatively conservative decrease of 20% the population may now be in the order of 2 000-4 800 birds, approximately equivalent to 1 400-3 360 mature individuals. However, in the absence of more concrete data on population densities, demographics and range size, the confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population is suspected to have declined at a moderate rate, in line with loss and degradation of its grassland habitat (BirdLife International 2014cb). It should be noted that even in core parts of the distribution range, and in ostensibly suitable habitat, the Yellow-breasted Pipit's occurrence is reliant on conservative land-management. In the Wakkerstroom area, for example, this species has undergone a considerable reduction in range and abundance because of intensive grazing and frequent burning of its grassland habitat. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">While Barnes (2000o) estimated that the population would decline by up to 20% between 2000-2011, SABAP data suggest that the EoO has decreased by nearly 40% and the AoO by greater than 50%. Assuming a linear relationship between a decrease in AoO and population size, it seems that the decline has been greater than  the 20% proposed by Barnes (2000o) and closer to 50%. Based upon threats to the Grassland Biome, the rate of decline is expected to increase and become increasingly rapid in the next ten years. Increased fragmentation, and isolation of sub-populations, is a concern.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">During the breeding season, the Yellow-breasted Pipit is restricted to sub-montane (greater than 1 400 m but more commonly greater than 2 000 m) sour grasslands c. 150-300 mm in height (Tar&#173;boton et al. 1987). It prefers moist, lush, rather tall but tussocky grassland, often interspersed with flowers and forbs, and nesting sites are usually situated on flat to gently undulating terrain. It is sensitive to disturbance and land-cover changes, and is usually absent from areas with excessive grazing or frequent (annual) burning. The high-altitude breeding grounds are partially vacated during the non-breeding season, when the species has been recorded in lower-lying grasslands, fallow lands and even savannah areas (Voelker 2005). The generation length of 3.7 years is the mean of two calculated values derived from published and/or extrapolated estimates of mean age at first breeding, maximum longevity in the wild and mean annual adult survival (BirdLife International 2014cb).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The grasslands of South Africa, on which the Yellow-breasted Pipit and a plethora of other threatened species rely, are very poorly conserved with less than 2.5% under formal protection and an estimated 80% irreversibly transformed. In moist high-altitude grasslands where this species breeds, agricultural practices and commercial afforestation have led to destruction of the majority of the remaining habitat (Allan et al. 1997b). These grasslands are heavily utilised for crop agriculture, which is becoming more prolific with population growth and food demands. Areas that are not under cultivation are almost all grazed by domestic livestock, and in many areas overgrazing is further reducing the available habitat of this disturbance-sensitive species (Little 2011). This pattern can be seen in previously well-populated areas, including the Wakkerstroom grasslands. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Overly frequent (annual) burning, especially spring burns, further limit available habitat for the Yellow-breasted Pipit, and only allow breeding attempts late in the season when the grass sward has recovered. In areas where heavy grazing succeeds late burns, grass cover may never recover sufficiently for nesting (Little 2011). A major threat that has emerged in recent years is the dramatically increased extent of open-cast coal mining within the species' range. Given its adaptation to high-altitude grasslands, the Yellow-breasted Pipit is likely to be significantly impacted by climate change, and was identified as a high-risk species in this regard by Simmons et al. (2004).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">One of the secondary effects of afforestation has been a significant increase in the abundance of Accipiter hawks, and particularly the Rufous-breasted Sparrowhawk A. rufiventris; this species frequents preys on Yellow-breasted Pipits and other terrestrial grassland passerines, and the Yellow-breasted Pipit's bright colouration and extended aerial display may make it especially vulnerable (D Pietersen pers. comm.). Although not quantified, increased predation from accipiters may constitute a severe threat. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation measures are currently implemented. A research project on the life history, conservation status and management of the species has recently commenced. Major aims are to determine the current distribution and population status, covering the historical, known current and predicted distribution in its entirety, to assess occupancy levels and habitat requirements, and to determine whether the Yellow-breasted Pipit can be used as an indicator species of ecological integrity of Moist Highland Grasslands (D Pietersen pers. comm.).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The amount of Moist Highland Grassland under conservation needs to increase and, ideally, no more of the little remaining intact grassland should be lost. The proposed Grassland Biosphere Reserve (IBA SA020) will play a critical role in the conservation of this species: important populations persist in the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park (IBA SA064) and Steenkampsberg (IBA SA016), in particular. Livestock grazing on existing intact grasslands should be conducted in a conservative manner without overgrazing or frequent burning, and spring burns should be avoided. A low stocking rate (greater than 5 ha/LAU) and biennial burning in winter (July) are recommended. Education of private, state and community land-owners is important, and incentives to land-owners to manage their properties for particular species, such as the Yellow-breasted Pipit, could prove to be effective conservation strategies.</p>

</div>
<div id="_idContainer988" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the magnificent Secretarybird Sagittarius serpentarius satisfied the criteria for regionally Vulnerable, having undergone a population size reduction of greater than 30% over the past 10 years; this reduction and its causes may not have ceased, is not fully understood and may not be reversible (A4). Trends are based on data from (a) direct observation, (c) a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat, and (d) levels of exploitation. In addition, the population size is estimated to number less than10 000 mature individuals and is projected to undergo a continuing decline of at least 10% within the next three generations.</p>
	<h2>Reasons for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the Secretarybird's global range occurs within the region. In addition, it was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The unique Secretarybird occupies the mono-generic family Sagittariidae. Despite suggestions of affinities with the Neotropical seriemas (Cariamidae) and other Gruiformes, it is best placed within the Accipitriformes, on the basis of morphological, behavioural and molecular similarities. The species is monotypic. </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">125-150 cm, 4 kg. An unmistakable, huge terrestrial raptorial bird, with long legs, elongated tail projections and elaborate black crest-like plumes. Sexes alike in appearance, but female slightly larger than male. Body and wing coverts mainly plain bluish grey, but breast paler and undertail coverts white. Rump, belly, upper leg feathering and flight feathers black. Tail grey with white tips and broad black sub-terminal band; central rectrices greatly elongated with broad tips. Bill and cere pale blue-grey. Eye brown. Bare skin from bill to behind eye orange. Legs and feet pinkish grey. Juvenile similar to adult but with browner plumage, grey-barred underwing and undertail coverts, black bill, grey eye becoming yellow later, and shorter central rectrices; bare facial skin yellow (Dean and Simmons 2005, Kemp and Kemp 2006)</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species is widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In South Africa the species has a broad distribution having been reported in 1 262 or 64.9% of South Africa's Quarter Degree Squares (QDSs) at the time of writing (Hofmeyr et al. 2014) In Swaziland, the species is only regularly encountered in Malolotja National Park and neighbouring areas in the north-east of the country (Monadjem et al. 2003). The species occurs sparsely in Lesotho, where it is found mainly in the western lowlands. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Secretarybirds are not migratory, but are highly mobile. Young birds in particular undertake extensive and often rapid movements (see map), primarily in arid areas, as indicated by fluctuations in numbers (Boshoff and Allan 1997, Herholdt and Anderson 2006). Simmons (2005) reported an individual that moved 1 537 km from its ringing site in the Mpumalanga Lowveld, to northern Namibia. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The density of breeding pairs varies across the range. Tarboton and Allan (1984) reported densities of 0.2-2.0 pairs/100 km2 across the former Transvaal, while Kemp (1995b) provides an estimate of 150 km2/pair in Highveld grasslands. A similar estimate of 140 km2/pair was made in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and inter-nest distances of 4.5-15 km suggest comparable densities (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Actual territory sizes are estimated to be smaller, due to unsuitable habitat or paucity of nest trees between territories, with Kemp (1994) reporting estimates of 70 km2/pair in Highveld grasslands and 45-20 km2/pair in open and more wooded savannahs. The species is well represented in the Important Bird Area network in South Africa, being reported from over 74 IBAs. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the Secretarybird remains unquantified, but is unlikely to be ‘above five figures' (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Numbers fluctuate widely between years in any one area (Tarboton and Allan 1984), making a regional population estimate extremely difficult. 1 068 pairs were estimated to occur in the former Transvaal (Tarboton and Allan 1984), although this estimate is almost certainly outdated. Kemp et al. (2001) estimated there to be 256±50 mature individuals in Kruger National Park and 128±50 mature individuals in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. Parker (1994a) estimated a total of 50 mature individuals in Swaziland, but Monadjem et al. (2003) reduced this to 10 mature individuals. 2 667 birds were recorded in the summer 2013 Coordinated Avifaunal Roadcounts (CAR) while 793 were recorded in winter surveys (Hofmeyr et al. 2014). However, CAR routes excluded large portions of the region, so the number of birds in South Africa could conceivably be between 3 500 and 5 000 mature individuals. The confidence in this estimate is low and requires verification.</p>
	<h2>Trend justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ad-hoc records, localised surveys and anecdotal observations indicate apparent declines in many parts of the species' global range and, based on this evidence, the Secretarybird is suspected to be undergoing a rapid decline globally (BirdLife International 2014bu). Various authors have also reported Secretarybird declines in the region. Boshoff et al. (1983) mentioned that the species had declined in Northern Cape and Western Cape provinces since 1960, while Hockey et al. (1989) mentioned a further decline in the southern Western Cape during the 1980s. Between 2009 and 2012, counts conducted by Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife have indicated a greater than 50% decline in Secretarybird numbers (Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife unpubl. data in Hofmeyr et al. 2014). A comparison of SABAP2 reporting rates has indicated a decrease of 73.5% relative to SABAP1 (Hofmeyr et al. 2014); reporting rates decreased in greater than 60% of the QDSs that the species was reported from in either atlas project. This consistent decrease in bird atlas reporting rates for the Secretarybird in a large proportion of QDSs suggests a decrease in abundance across most of its South African range between 1991 and 2007 (Hofmeyr et al. 2014). A 27% decline in AoO from SABAP1 to SABAP2 further reinforces the conclusion that the regional population is in decline. The population trend is therefore deemed negative and ongoing. The rate of decline over the past three generations is greater than 30% although the exact rate of decline is unknown. The confidence in population trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species prefers open grassland and scrub, with the ground cover shorter than 50 cm and with sufficient scattered trees as roost/nest sites. It extends into savannah where sufficiently open areas exist (Boshoff and Allan 1997, Dean and Simmons 2005). It is absent from Mountain Fynbos, forest, dense woodland and very rocky, hilly or mountainous woodland (Boshoff and Allan 1997). It occurs from sea-level to montane grasslands over 2000 m. The species normally occurs singly or in pairs, although groups of up to 50 have been recorded at waterholes in arid areas (Herholdt and Anderson 2006). The species displays opportunistic life history traits, such as variable clutch size (1-3 eggs) and variable nestling (47-106 days) and post-fledging independence (62-105 days) periods, as well as the ability to raise successive broods after a one-month interval (Kemp 1995b). Nests are large, stick platforms usually built on top of isolated flat-crowned trees, and particularly vachellias (acacias); where indigenous thorny trees are not available, alien pines or wattles may also be used (Tarboton 2011).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Such adaptive trails indicate that it may have the potential to exploit marginal conditions and therefore recover rapidly from population declines (Barnes 2000o). Reproductive success varies greatly between localities and years. Kemp (1995b) reported an average of greater than 1 offspring/pair/year at a site outside of Pretoria, Gauteng whilst Herholdt and Anderson (2006) reported 2.2 offspring/pair/year in the Kalahari. A generation length of 12.7 years is the mean of two estimated values derived from published and/or extrapolated estimates of mean age at first breeding, maximum longevity in the wild and mean annual adult survival (BirdLife International 2014bu).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Secretarybirds are indiscriminate predators of a great variety of small animals. The majority of the diet consists of invertebrates, and particularly Orthoptera. However, a diversity of small mammals, birds and their eggs, reptiles (including tortoises) and amphibians are also consumed. </p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Habitat loss, driven by agriculture and urban development, is the primary threat to this species (Barnes 2000o, Hofmeyr et al. 2014). Excessive burning and overgrazing of grasslands for livestock may reduce carrying capacity and availability of prey species (Parker 1994). Bush encroachment, which renders habitat unsuitable for Secretarybirds, has been proposed as the driver behind declines in abundance in Kruger National Park (Hofmeyr et al. 2014) and in Swaziland (Parker 1994). To a smaller extent, trade of the species may be problematic but limited data are available and it uncertain whether the regional population is affected by this activity. Direct hunting and nest-raiding for uses other than trade have also been reported (Monadjem et al. 2003). Indiscriminate poisoning at waterholes is also listed as a potential threat, as is drowning in sheer-walled reservoirs (Anderson et al. 1999). Secretarybirds suffer mortalities through collisions with power-lines (Hartley 1991) and there is a risk in South Africa that wind farms might negatively affect this species in the future (EF Retief pers. obs). Secretarybirds are widely acknowledged as snake-eaters by rural people; ironically, persecution and disturbance of Secretarybirds at the nest, impedes the natural snake control that the birds exert. </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A collaborative research project on the species was initiated in 2012 (see Research Priorities and Questions box, below).The species is listed as Endangered in Swaziland and is protected under the Swaziland Game Act (Monadjem et al. 2003). It is listed as Appendix II under CITES.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The protection of breeding sites outside of the protected area network using land-use agreements is required. An awareness programme involving land-owners and local communities, which highlights the threats facing this species, is recommended. Further appropriate conservation measures need to be determined as relevant research questions are being answered.</p>

	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US">BirdLife South Africa, the Birds of Prey Working Group of the Endangered Wildlife Trust, and the University of the Witwatersrand created a partnership in 2012 to undertake research on the species. This research includes study of the breeding biology and movements of the species to determine details of juvenile dispersal, territory size and habitat use.

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Black Stork Ciconia nigra is estimated at less than1 000 mature individuals satisfying the population size criterion for regionally Vulnerable. In addition, a population size reduction of greater than 30% is suspected to have occurred over a 47 year period (three generations).</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this species occurs within the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No notable issues. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">95-110 cm, 2.8 kg. A massive black stork, with a red bill and legs. Sexes differ slightly in size and bill dimensions. Head, neck and remainder of upperparts, including wings, black. Back has a glossy green sheen with purplish coverts. Upper breast black; lower breast, belly and undertail coverts white. Tail black. Skin around eye, bill and legs bright red. Eyes dark brown. Juvenile browner than adult, lacking iridescence. Bill, facial skin and legs dull grey-green (Anderson 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Black Stork breeds widely across the Palearctic region and is a partial migrant into sub-Saharan Africa, remaining largely north of the equator (Snow and Perrins 1998, Hancock et al. 2010). The Sahelo-Sudanian part of Africa (the south of Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger and the north of Benin) constitutes the principal known wintering destination of Black Storks from Western Europe between September and March (Chevallier et al. 2011, Jiguet et al. 2011). The population occurring in southern Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique is isolated from that in the northern hemisphere (Siegfried 1967). Within the region, it occurs predominantly in the southern and eastern provinces, avoiding the drier interior and west (Siegfried 1967). The species is suspected to undergo complex seasonal movements (Tarboton et al. 1987). The EoO provided by SABAP2 is large (1 481 285 km2) and has decreased only slightly (4.26%). In contrast, the AoO has decreased dramatically from 531 886 km2 to 193 128 km2, a decline of 63.7%. The species is well represented in the protected areas network, occurring in over 40 IBAs. </p>
	<h2>POPULATION JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 24 000-44 000 mature individuals (Dodman and Diagana 2006). There are no reliable up to date estimates for the region. Clancey (1985) provided an initial southern African population estimate of c. 400 mature individuals which was updated by Dodman and Diagana (2006a) to 1 560-4 050 mature individuals. Osborne and Tigar (1990) estimated there to be up to 50 pairs in Lesotho while Parker (1994a) estimated 10 pairs in Swaziland. While these figures are out of date, it is estimated that the regional population is less than1 000 mature individuals. Confidence in this estimate is low and a revision of the regional population size is urgently required.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population trend of the global population is unknown (BirdLife International 2014bu). The AoO occupied by this species has decreased dramatically between reporting periods (63.7%), suggesting a decline in the regional population. The relationship between a decline in AoO and population size is however not always linear and the confidence in this population decline is low. However, it is suspected that the decline is greater than 30%.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Black Stork is a solitary, cliff-nester (Hancock et al. 2010). Breeding takes place in winter which is an adaptation to take advantage of an abundance of prey in waterbodies with receding water levels (Siegfried 1967). Typically 2-5 eggs are laid. Nest predators include Verreauxs' Eagle Aquila verreauxii, Martial Eagle Polemaetus bellicosus and Chacma Baboon Papio ursinus (Cannell 1991). The Black Stork is one of few species to practise parental infanticide (Klosowski et al. 2002). A generation length of 15.9 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014bu). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Black Stork is mainly piscivorous with fish constituting 91% of the diet (Chevallier et al. 2008). The species is absent from seasonal pans lacking fish (Allan 1997e) but is readily found at dams, shallow pans and floodplains. The diet of nestlings differs to that of adults, and is predominantly made up of amphibians and insects (Hampl et al. 2005). Chevallier et al. (2008) found no correlation between the abundance of fish and sites selected by Black Storks, and suggest that the selection of fishing areas are influenced by other factors such as human activities.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Black Stork is reliant on shallow waterbodies, such as estuaries and rivers, in which it forages (Chevallier et al. 2008). The degradation of wetlands and the damming of small rivers have undoubtedly had a negative impact on this species. Individuals sometimes collide with power-lines. Black Stork have been persecuted at commercial fish farming operations (DG Allan pers. comm.).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are currently no species-specific conservation interventions underway for this species. The Black Stork is listed as Vulnerable under the National Environmental Management Act Biodiversity Act 10 of 2004 and as well as the Swaziland Game Act of 1991. It is placed in the Fourth Schedule: Specially Protected of the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Management Amendment Act No. 5 of 1999.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The location of nest sites needs to be ascertained and measures put in place to minimise the amount of disturbance at these sites. Efforts to reduce environmental impacts on the flow of perennial rivers in the region need to be supported. </p>

<div id="_idContainer1011" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Caspian Tern Sterna caspia is estimated to be less than1 000 mature individuals. In addition, the species has a restricted number of breeding locations leaving it prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a short time period. Accordingly, the species is assessed as regionally Vulnerable. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of the Caspian Tern occurs within the region. In addition, the species was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Recent reviews of the Sterninae sub-family (e.g. Bridge et al. 2005) place the Caspian Tern in the monospecific genus Hydroprogne, based mainly on molecular and morphological evidence. The southern African population is geographically and perhaps genetically isolated (Cooper et al. 1992), but is not afforded subspecific status; the species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">47-54 cm; c. 690 g. The largest tern; more reminiscent of a gull in terms of size and the massive red bill. Cap black. Nape, scapulars and back pale grey. Rump and tail white. Upperwing pale grey with white trailing edge, depending on wear and moult. Underwing white with diagnostic blackish grey outer primaries. Underparts white. Bill red with pale tip and black sub-terminal band. Eyes reddish brown. Feet and legs black with orange or pink soles. Sexes alike, but female slightly smaller. Non-breeding adult shows white streaks on crown. Juvenile has paler, more orange-toned bill and greyish yellow to dark orange legs. Feathers of mantle, scapulars and some wing coverts with scaled pattern. Lacks dark carpal characteristic of many young terns (Tree 2005c).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Despite being distributed globally, the species is thinly spread throughout the Holarctic, Australasian, Oriental and Afrotropical regions (Voous 1960). Within the region, it is concentrated at estuaries and sheltered bays along the coastline and at large, permanent inland waterbodies (Brooke 1984). Twenty-eight historical breeding localities are known although the species currently breeds at only ten sites, two of which are Important Bird Areas, namely iSimangaliso Wetland Park (IBA SA058) and West Coast National Park and Saldanha Bay Islands (IBA SA105). The movement of a ringed bird from Algoa Bay, Eastern Cape to Lake St Lucia suggests that the southern African breeding populations may not be isolated from each other (Martin 1991).</p>
	<h2>POPULATION JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated to number c. 240 000-420 000 mature individuals (Dodman and Diagana 2006). The regional population is a small portion of this. In 2011 in Western Cape, 69 pairs bred on private property near Velddrif; eight pairs bred at Caspian Island in the southern portion of Langebaan Lagoon; one pair bred on each of Jutten, Meeuw and Schaapen islands in Saldanha Bay; and one pair bred on Robben Island offshore from Cape Town (Crawford et al. 2012a). Further east, several pairs breed at De Mond Nature Reserve near Aniston. Crawford et al. (2009b) reported c. 50 pairs at the Swartkops River estuary in Eastern Cape and c. 170 pairs at False Bay in Lake St Lucia, KwaZulu-Natal. The regional breeding population is in the order of 300-316 pairs (Kemper et al. 2007, Crawford et al. 2012a). The confidence in this population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is increasing, although some populations are decreasing, stable, or have unknown trends (Dodman and Diagana 2006). Between 1980-1991, Cooper et al. (1992) estimated the regional population to be in the order of 1 500 birds with about 1 000 of those being mature individuals. It must be noted that there is sometimes extreme fluctuations in the number of birds breeding at a locality; for example, counts at Lake St Lucia, KwaZulu-Natal between 1975 and 1985 ranged from as low as six to a maximum of 833 birds (Ryan et al. 1986). The current population estimate of 600-650 mature individuals represents a reduction of 30-35% over three generations. Confidence in this regional trend estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds colonially, with the season varying between localities (Crawford 1997b). The number of colonies used for breeding and the numbers of birds present at each varies widely between years (Crawford 1997b). Breeding habitat used along the coast is largely offshore islands with an increasing use of sandy beaches and islands at salt works, where protection is offered (du Toit et al. 2003). Breeding at inland sites takes place on small, low islets in pans and dams. Caspian Terns are intolerant of any form of disturbance while breeding. A generation length of 12.2 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014bw). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Hunting is carried out 3-20 m above the water, parallel to, and within 100 m of the shoreline. Birds dive head first into water when catching prey (Cyrus and McLean 1994) and feed throughout the day with most activity during the morning. Their diet consists almost entirely of fish of 5-20 cm in length and weighing 10-20 g. </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threats to this species are during the breeding period when it is highly susceptible to human disturbance including through egg collecting and predation by domestic dogs (Martin and Randall 1987), and even potentially through avitourism. Extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, droughts and heat waves can also impact on the breeding success of this species (du Toit et al. 2003). Underhill (2000e) pointed out that rising water levels may flood nests, while falling water levels grant access to terrestrial predators. Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus are also notable nest predators. Lesser threats which deserve more investigation include the bio-accumulation of heavy metals, pesticides, and other chemical pollutants (to which this species may be particularly prone because it eats relatively large fish); this may lead to eggshell thinning and other impacts on breeding success (Underhill 2000c). </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Jutten, Schaapen, Meeuw and Caspian islands are all accorded Ramsar site status and, together with West Coast National Park, fall within the National Park network. Lake St Lucia is included under the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a World Heritage Site as well as a Ramsar site. The species is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals and under the African Eurasian Waterbird Agreement. The species is included in CWAC surveys undertaken under the auspices of the Animal Demography Unit of the University of Cape Town. There are no other current species-specific conservation measures underway.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The legal protection of breeding sites at locations outside formally protected areas is proposed. At some breeding sites, particularly those at artificial waterbodies, sensitive management or judicious alteration could increase breeding success, for example by maintaining optimal water levels, raising islands to avoid flooding, or by excluding predators (Cooper et al. 1992). Habitat management and monitoring are further management recommendations (du Toit et al. 2003). A full study of what conservation measures will be most successful should also be conducted. Disturbance at breeding and roosting sites should be limited. The primary factor limiting populations in other parts of the world is lack of suitable nest sites, and the possibility of creating artificial nesting opportunities (such as was done for Lesser Flamingo Phoeniconaias minor at Kamfers Dam, Kimberley) should be investigated.</p>

<div id="_idContainer1025" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Knysna Warbler Bradypterus sylvaticus is classified as regionally Vulnerable due to its small, severely fragmented range and small population (c. 2 500 mature individuals). In addition, all sub-populations contain less than1 000 mature individuals and there is a perceived continuing decline in population size, range size, and area, extent and quality of habitat. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Knysna Warbler is endemic to the region. In addition, the species was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Clancey (1980) recognised two subspecies, with the nominate sylvaticus (type from Knysna) being replaced by pondoensis (type from Port St Johns) in the coastal forests of Eastern Cape, and at least formerly, southern KwaZulu-Natal between Wentworth and Umhlanga Rocks near Durban (where last recorded in 1932). There are wide gaps in the distributions of the two races, but pondoensis especially has undergone a severe range contraction in the past 60 years, and the ranges of the two forms may formerly have been more continuous; the interface between them is poorly defined but may lie between Port Elizabeth and East London. Most modern taxonomies (e.g. Kennerly and Pearson 2010, Gill and Donsker 2015) place Bradypterus in the family Locustellidae, along with the genera Locustella, Schoenicola, Megalurus and several smaller lineages, restricting Sylviidae (sensu stricto) to sylviid babblers including ‘warblers' of the genus Sylvia.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">14-15 cm. A medium-sized, drab brown, secretive warbler that is normally overlooked unless singing. Sexes differ slightly in plumage colouration with the male having chocolate or olive-brown upperparts and an indistinct, greyish supercillium plus a dark triangular mark on the lores bordered below by a short, white stripe (facial features lacking in female). Tail typical of Bradypterus, being dark brown, broad and graduated. Underparts slightly paler brown than upperparts; throat and upper breast streaked darker brown. Bill brown, as is eye. Legs pale flesh to olive-brown. Adult female similar to male, but lacks dark loral spot with white lower border, and throat paler, bordered by indistinct dark moustachial stripes. Juvenile similar to adult, but face and underparts washed yellowish, and throat and breast streaked brown (Smith 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Knysna Warbler is endemic to the region and has a highly restricted and fragmented distribution, being found in four zones in the littoral of Eastern and Western Cape provinces. The northernmost zone, which once extended to the vicinity of Durban (Berruti et al. 1993), now covers the stretch of coastal vegetation between Mbombazi Nature Reserve, south of Margate in KwaZulu-Natal (Wragg 2003, Smith 2005), to Dwesa-Cwebe Nature Reserve in Eastern Cape. A vagrant recently recorded in Pietermaritzburg may be attributable to this population (subspecies pondoensis). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The next sub-population occurs between Tsitsikamma and Sedgefield (Berruti 1997d), with a third sub-population persisting on the southern slopes of the Langeberg Mountains, near Swellendam (Berruti 2000b). A fourth sub-population occurs on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain on the Cape Peninsula (Pryke et al. 2011). It is not known if there is movement between these sub-populations and ringing records are inconclusive (n = 14, retraps = 2). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The EoO estimates, provided by SABAP2, indicate that there has been a slight increase (15.9%), which is due to a single record in southern KwaZulu-Natal. There has been a 12.9% decrease in AoO. Conclusions drawn from atlas data may be biased owing to a lack of coverage in remote areas between the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast and East London in the former Transkei, and should be treated with caution. The cryptic nature of the Knysna Warbler means that it is likely to be under-recorded and it may be more abundant than atlas data suggest.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Knysna Warbler is extremely secretive and its presence is normally revealed only during the breeding season when it sings. Contact calls, uttered by both sexes, are diagnostic but indistinctive. It is certain that this, coupled with the inaccessibility of most of its habitat, has led to it being under-recorded in both atlas projects (DG Allan pers comm.). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The south-western sub-population, due to its proximity to Cape Town, has received the most attention from researchers. In 1977, Pringle (1977) estimated that there were less than100 pairs on the eastern slopes of the Cape Peninsula. This number may have been further reduced by the removal of thickets of alien Rubus brambles, notably in the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. More recently, this sub-population has been estimated to be in the region of 25-30 pairs (PAR Hockey unpubl. data), indicating a substantial decline. Hockey et al. (1989) suggested that there were less than200 pairs in the former south-western Cape, which would include the two southernmost sub-populations. Further east, Berruti et al. (1993) make mention that the species is rare in Eastern Cape, but do not provide an estimate. They did, however, estimate that the total population size was of the order of 10 000s, which is far lower than the 100 000s suggested by Siegfried (1992). The figure provided by Berruti et al. (1993) in 1993 was revised in 2000 to c. 2 500 individuals (Berruti 2000b). BirdLife International (2014bx) provided an estimate of 2 500 birds. The variance in population estimates can be attributed to the cryptic nature of this species, which has made population estimates particularly problematic and does not necessarily indicate rapid fluctuations or population declines. The current population estimate is less than2 500 mature individuals. The confidence in population estimates is low, given the lack of information on the species.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There is no current estimate of population trends. Pryke et al. (2011) made mention that, over the past 20 years, the Knysna Warbler has declined precipitously on the Cape Peninsula, but do not provide an estimate of sub-population size. The clearance of habitat for developments, agriculture and silviculture in the four zones in which the species occurs will have led to decreases in the amount of available habitat, as well as its quality, resulting in a decrease in the population. This decrease is expected to continue given the development pressure throughout the species' range. The rate of decline is unknown.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Knysna Warbler occurs along the edges of Afro-temperate forests and in thick, tangled vegetation along the banks of watercourses or drainage lines in forest patches in the Fynbos Biome (Berruti 1997d). It has adapted to thickets of introduced Rubus brambles, where it can be locally common, particularly in Western Cape. Birds have recently started to abandon natural, protected forests in favour of narrow belts of suburban riverine woodland with a dense, tangled understorey (Pryke et al. 2011). This was attributed to the availability of nesting substrate as opposed to prey availability (Pryke et al. 2011). In parts of the range, such around George, the species is also regularly recorded in overgrown suburban gardens with dense understorey vegetation (PJ Ginn pers. comm.). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Knysna Warbler is insectivorous, taking a range of invertebrates, but favouring arachnids and amphipods (Visser and Hockey 2002). It breeds in spring and early summer, August-December (Smith 2005), at which time local invertebrates are at their most abundant (Pryke and Samways 2008).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Berruti (1997d) attributed the contraction in range of the northern sub-population to habitat loss brought about by clearance of coastal forests and development on the coastline of southern KwaZulu-Natal. Habitat loss would also seem to be the main cause for decline in the western sub-population, with much of the species' original habitat on the Cape Peninsula having been lost to agriculture, urbanisation and exotic tree plantations (Pryke and Samways 2008). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Interestingly Visser and Hockey (2002) found that this species fares better in transformed urban landscapes than in adjacent protected areas, but this may have been due to unsuitable management practices within the protected area. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Wildfires on the Cape Peninsula are of concern because these may burn substantial patches of habitat. Although Fynbos is fire-adapted, Knysna Warbler habitat in Western Cape is often adjacent to large stands of introduced pine trees, where fires are more intense and its effects more devastating (Berruti 2000b). Given the close proximity of the key remaining sites holding this species on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, this sub-population could be driven to extinction by a single massive fire event (Berruti 2000b). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Little is known about the dispersal ability of this species, but continued fragmentation and isolation of sub-populations could lead to inbreeding depression.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Despite this species being listed as regionally as well as globally Vulnerable, there are currently no conservation measures underway. The Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology has been responsible for research on the western sub-population.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Conservation of this species depends on the maintenance of its prime habitat within Afro-temperate forests (Berruti 2000b). In much of the bird's range on the Cape Peninsula, adjacent Fynbos areas have been protected from fire since the 1970s (Forsyth and Van Wilgen 2008) despite the fact that the natural fire regime for the area is 12-15 year burns. Fynbos protected from fire becomes invaded by, and eventually replaced by forest. As such forest spreads laterally from riverine ravines into adjacent Fynbos, and lateral light is reduced, making the understorey vegetation more sparse (Pryke et al. 2011). The warbler, whose breeding requirements include a dense understorey, has been impacted upon by this fire regime. In addition, manual removal of the non-flammable forest component of invaded Fynbos vegetation may be a prerequisite (Pryke et al. 2011). The species' dependence on dense riparian vegetation indicates that clearing of undergrowth, including alien species, would be detrimental. Eggs and chicks are subject to intense depredation, much of which is probably caused by rodents (Visser and Hockey 2002). Management practices that impact negatively on populations of predators of rodents may have knock-on effects on the productivity of warblers.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The status of the global population of Light-mantled Albatross Phoebetria palpebrata is poorly known. Due to the impact on breeding colonies by invasive predators and mortalities experienced in longline bycatch, the global population is thought to be in decline justifying its global Near Threatened status. Within the region, Light-mantled Albatross is restricted to the Prince Edward Islands, satisfying the Near Threatened criterion under D2 (population with a very restricted area of occupancy or number of locations (typically five or fewer) such that it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period in an uncertain future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period). However, it was felt that it was unlikely that stochastic events or human activities at the Prince Edward Islands would lead to this species becoming Extinct or even Critically Endangered within one to two generations, although there is a possibility that such activities could result in the Light-mantled Albatross being listed as Vulnerable or Endangered during that period.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Light-mantled Albatross breed at the Prince Edward Islands and is a rare visitor to South African waters. It was assessed in 2000 as regionally Near Threatened and is currently listed as globally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Monotypic. No notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">85-90 cm, 2.4-2.7 kg. Sexes alike although male slightly larger. A small, all-brown albatross with a wedge-shaped tail. It is named for the conspicuously paler mantle which contrasts with the otherwise uniformly chocolate-brown, velvety plumage. Upper breast and mantle pale, yellow-brown, giving the appearance of being bleached relative to the rest of the plumage. White crescent above and behind eye. Bill black with blue sulcus. Juvenile and immature similar to adult. Dark, pale-billed giant petrels (Macronectes spp.) are bulkier with shorter, stubbier wings. The Sooty Albatross P. fusca has yellow sulcus and is uniformly brown, lacking the pale mantle (Ryan 2005n).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Light-mantled Albatross breeds on the Prince Edward Islands as well as Iles de Kerguelen, Iles Crozet (France), Heard and Macquarie islands, (Australia), South Georgia, and the Auckland, Campbell and Antipodes islands (New Zealand) (ACAP 2011b). Although little is known regarding its at-sea movements (Ryan 2005n), it is believed to range widely across the Southern Ocean, seldom venturing into continental shelf waters (Ryan 1997d). It has a much more southerly distribution than its sister species, the Sooty Albatross, and is associated with the edge of the pack ice and Antarctic waters. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global annual breeding population has been quantified at c. 20 500 breeding pairs (ACAP 2011b). Ryan et al. (2009a) estimated there to be 120 pairs and 600 pairs on Prince Edward and Marion islands, respectively, giving a regional population of c. 720 pairs. Light-mantled Albatrosses are difficult to count due to their dark plumage and cliff nesting habits (Ryan et al. 2009a), lowering the confidence in this regional population estimate to medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Limited information is available to determine global population trends for the species but declines have been reported at all sites where repeated surveys have been carried out (ACAP 2011b). The Marion Island population decreased by 25% between 1990 and 1998 or at about 2.6% per year (Crawford et al. 2003b), increased by 5% per year up to 2005 (Ryan et al. 2009a), undergoing a further slight decrease until 2008. The decline over three generations is less than30%. Confidence in this population trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Light-mantled Albatross nests solitarily or in small colonies on sea cliffs and inland cliffs, showing high natal fidelity. It is a biennial breeder, laying a single egg in October-November (Weimerskirch et al. 1986). Breeding success in 1978 on Marion Island was 31% (Berruti 1979). Feeding is mainly through surface-seizing with squid, fish, and crustaceans featuring prominently in the diet (Cherel and Klages 1998). It can dive to 10 m and its dark plumage may be related to nocturnal foraging (Prince et al. 1994, Cooper and Klages 1995). At Marion Island, seabirds comprised an important part of the diet, presumably from scavenging carcasses (Cooper and Klages 1995). It seldom follows or associates with ships (Ryan 2005n).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat at sea is from bycatch in tuna longline fishing (Nel et al. 2002a). Trawling on sea-mounts in the south-west Indian Ocean is a potential threat but data are lacking. Population decreases are considered to be due to at sea mortality associated with fisheries, particularly longline fishing vessels (Delord et al. 2008). Introduced House Mice Mus musculus have been reported to have preyed on a single chick of the closely related Sooty Albatross at Marion Island (Jones and Ryan 2010), and more widespread attacks occurred in 2015 (PG Ryan in litt.). This may pose a serious threat and should be investigated as a matter of urgency. </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Internationally, the Light-mantled Albatross is protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and petrels - Annex 1 and by the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species - Appendix II. Within the region it is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Publication of Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch on Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (2008). The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and are managed through the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ongoing efforts by BirdLife International, as well as BirdLife South Africa, to reduce incidental mortality of seabirds in fisheries industries, should be supported. Observer programmes, essential for the reporting of the scale of incidental mortality and potential effectiveness of mitigation measures, must be continued. The eradication of introduced mice on Marion Island should be considered based upon results of research into the patterns and scale of mouse predation on the chicks of Light-mantled Albatross and other pelagic seabirds.</p>

	<h2>JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Shy Albatross Thalassarche cauta is listed as globally Near Threatened with populations approaching but not exceeding the 30% decline threshold for classification as Vulnerable. The species does not breed on the Prince Edward Islands but occurs in large numbers in South African waters. Accordingly, the global status is adopted and the Shy Albatross is classified as regionally Near Threatened. The classification of this albatross is disputed, and any changes in its species-level taxonomy will necessitate a re-evaluation of its conservation status.</p>
	<h2>Reasons for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was assessed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000, and is currently classified as globally Near Threatened. A large portion of the global population occurs within 200nm of South Africa and, as with other albatrosses, it is susceptible to mortality caused by foraging in longline fisheries. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was originally part of the polytypic species Diomedea cauta (Gould 1841). The separation of this taxon into four separate species, namely Chatham Albatross T. eremita, Salvin's Albatross T. salvini, White-capped Albatross T. steadi and Shy Albatross T. cauta, was controversial (Robertson and Nunn 1998, Penhallurick and Wink 2004).and the he distinction between T. cauta and T. steadi is still contentious and was not accepted by Brooke (2004) or Onley and Scofield (2007). BirdLife South Africa follows the taxonomic recommendations of the International Ornithologist's Union and for the purposes of this assessment treats both shy-type albatrosses as a single species.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">90-100 cm, 3.7-4.4 kg. The largest of the dark-backed Thalassarche albatrosses. Sexes alike although males slightly larger. Head and body of adults predominantly white with a variable amount of grey wash on the neck. Back dark grey, contrasting with darker upperwings. Underwing white with narrow black margins on the leading and trailing edges. The species shows a diagnostic dark ‘thumbprint' mark at the base of the leading edge of the underwing. Rump and upper tail coverts grey, and tail slate-grey. Eyes dark brown. Legs and feet pale bluish flesh. Immature has a grey bill with a dark tip and a variable amount of grey on the neck (Ryan 2005o).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The nominate subspecies T. c. cauta breeds exclusively at three islands off Tasmania, namely Albatross, Pedra Branca and Mewstone (Gales 1998). It has an unusually restricted foraging range with non-breeding and breeding adults remaining in close proximity to their breeding grounds, while immature and juvenile birds disperse westwards to South Africa (Marchant and Higgins 1990) and the South Atlantic Ocean (Tickell 2000). In South African waters, newly fledged juvenile birds arrive off Eastern Cape mid to late August and off Western Cape from late August to September. T. c. steadi breeds on Disappointment, Auckland and Adams islands in the Auckland Islands group, Bollon's Island in the Antipodes Islands group and occasionally on the Forty-Fours in the Chatham Islands group (Robertson et al. 1997). Juveniles and non-breeding adults are thought to range throughout the waters of southern Australia and South Africa (Thompson and Sagar 2007). Baker et al. (2007) reported that 95% of Shy-type albatrosses killed by longliners in South African waters are T. c. steadi.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">BirdLife International (2014by) provides a global population estimate of c. 92 000 pairs. As of 2011, there were c. 5 200 pairs of T. c. cauta at Albatross Island, c. 170 pairs at Pedra Branca and c. 9 500 pairs at Mewstone Island. The quality of data is influenced by the accessibility of the breeding sites. Approximately 77 000 pairs of T. c. steadi breed on the Auckland Islands (ACAP 2011c). There is a suggestion that this species might be a biennial breeder, in which case the number of adults would require review (ACAP 2011c). Confidence in this population and subsequent trend justification is medium.</p>
	<h2>Trend justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to be undergoing a decline. Colonies of the nominate subspecies on Pedra Branca are in steep decline while the population trend of the Mewstone Island colony is unknown. While counts of T. c. steadi have indicated an increase from 75 000 breeding pairs in 1993 (Gales 1998) to a current figure of 97 000 pairs in 2007 (Baker et al. 2009), these estimates were not based on comparable methodologies. Counts since 2007 are comparable with current estimates and unfortunately seem to indicate a population in substantial decline (BirdLife International 2014by). The reported figures of bycatch (BirdLife International 2014by), which include substantial numbers of Shy Albatross, seem to reinforce the conclusion that this species is undergoing a decline. However, 2007-2011 counts indicate a highly variable inter-annual population and the possibility of a biennially breeding species indicating that the decline is not as steep as previously thought. Consequently, this rapid population decline cannot yet be confirmed and the confidence in the global trend estimate is low. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Ecology </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Shy Albatross breeds annually in colonies on small, rocky islands, laying a single egg in summer (Marchant and Higgins 1990). A generation length of 23.1 years was calculated based on extrapolated mean age at first breeding and extrapolated mean annual survival (BirdLife International 2014by) although data used to calculate this figure are poor (BirdLife International 2014by). Birds mostly forage at or near the surface but do occasionally dive (Ryan 2005o). On trawling grounds, it often sits on water in rafts of tens to hundreds with other scavengers waiting for nets to surface (Ryan 2005o). </p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At-sea mortalities, due to commercial fishing operations, is the primary threat to Shy Albatrosses with over 8 500 birds being killed annually in South African, Namibian and New Zealand demersal trawl fisheries and the South African pelagic longline fishery (Baker et al. 2007). In the latter fishery, birds were reported to be caught at a rate of 0.09 per 1 000 hooks set and comprised a quarter of the albatrosses killed (Petersen et al. 2009a), amounting to c. 600 birds being caught per year. The majority of individuals caught (73%) were juvenile/immature birds (Petersen et al. 2009a). The South African demersal trawl fishery was responsible for killing c. 5 000 birds per year (Petersen et al. 2009b), but this has now been virtually eliminated (Maree et al. 2014). The vulnerability of both adult and juvenile T. c. steadi to incidental mortality during fishing operations appears to be much greater than  for T. c. cauta, as they occur over a wider geographic range throughout their lives. Land-based threats include avian pox virus, which was detected on Albatross Island; the demographic consequences are un&#173;known (Woods 2004).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Internationally the Shy Albatross is protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels - Annex 1 and by the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species - Appendix II. The species is considered regionally Vulnerable under the National Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act 1999) and State (Tasmanian Government Threatened Species Protection Act 1995) legislation. Within the region it is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Publication of Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch on Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (2008).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The South African offshore demersal trawl fishery was a ‘very high impact' fishery for seabirds overall, and in particular, for Shy Albatross, accounting for 60% of estimated mortality while the longline fishery accounts for 7% of global mortality estimates (Baker et al. 2007). While the impact of the trawl fishery in South Africa appears to have abated, is it essential that measures to prevent bycatch are implemented in all longline and trawl fisheries, including on the high seas. Furthermore, the range of this species extends into Namibia, where there are currently no measures required to reduce seabird bycatch in any of their fisheries. The Namibian government and fishing industry should remedy that situation as a matter of urgency.</p>

Greater coverts and outer median coverts white with black sub-terminal marks, forming checkered patch visible on folded wing. Flight feathers grey brown, with multiple white bars. Tail grey brown, whiter towards base, overlaid with several dark bars. Bill pale horn. Eyes lemon-yellow. Legs yellow to dark cream. Female similar to male, but with less distinct facial markings. Juvenile similar but with shorter crest, more freckled upperparts, and paler eyes. </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Kori Bustard occurs in two distinct populations in southern and East Africa, separated by the broad-leaved miombo woodland belt of Central Africa (Allan 1997f). The strongholds of the southern African subspecies, A. k. kori, are in Botswana and Namibia, with populations also occurring in southern Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe (Johnsgard 1991). The species is a vagrant to Lesotho and Parker (1999) reported the bird as being scarce in southern Mozambique. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Within the region, the Kori Bustard is found predominantly in the dry savannahs of Eastern Cape, Free State, North West and Northern Cape provinces, penetrating eastwards into moist and semi-arid woodlands along the Limpopo River Valley and into the Kruger National Park of Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces (Allan and Osborne 2005). It probably formerly occurred throughout the Savannah Biome in the former Transvaal, where its present range is only a fragment of its former distribution (Tarboton et al. 1987). Historically, it occurred in the lowland areas of Swaziland where hunting, and possibly bush encroachment, has resulted in local extinction (Parker 1994). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species occurs in 15 IBAs in the region although the majority of the population occurs outside of these protected areas. Differences in global EoO estimates (based on Minimum Convex Polygons) by Senyatso et al. (2013) indicate an 8% decline in southern Africa when comparing pre- and post-1970s distribution; the majority of the range contraction within the region occurred in Swaziland and Eastern Cape province in south-east South Africa (Senyatso et al. 2013). The EoO difference between SABAP1 and SABAP2 shows little change (c. 4%) while the AoO between the two reporting periods has declined by 55% although this may be due to a lack of survey effort in remote parts of Northern Cape and North West provinces.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014bz). An estimate of 143-191 breeding pairs and 368-613 individual birds occurring across 18 IBAs was provided by Barnes (1998) with the largest concentrations in Kruger National Park and Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (Barnes 1998). Anderson (2000h) provided a regional estimate of between 2 000-5 000 mature individuals, although no justification for this figure is provided. The confidence in this regional population estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is thought to be decreasing but the rate of decline is unknown (Lichtenberg and Hallager 2008, BirdLife International 2014bz). Kori Bustard numbers in the region declined throughout the 20th century but the extent of decline is unknown (Brooke 1984, Dale 1990). The large decline in AoO between the two atlas periods is a cause for concern although this may be attributed to a lack of survey effort in parts of its range. Based mostly upon anecdotal evidence, the regional population is perceived to be in a state of decline but the rate at which it is declining is unknown. Exacerbating this perceived regional decline is a low reproductive rate, making recovery from such declines difficult (Dale 1990). Indeed, while the evidence for a decline is relatively strong (Senyatso et al. 2013), unfortunately knowledge regarding the rate of decline is lacking and consequently the confidence in this trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Kori Bustard is usually found alone or in small groups (Allan and Osborne 2005), although as many as 46 individuals have been recorded feeding next to each other in an open pan (Allan 1997f). The species inhabits fairly dry, open savannahs, within the 100-600 mm rainfall zone, as well as Nama Karoo dwarf shrublands and occasionally western grasslands where clumps of trees on tree-lined watercourses provide shade and shelter (Allan 1997f). Adult and sub-adult males may disperse up to 120 km outside the breeding season, occupying home ranges of 8.6-66.3 km2 (Osborne and Osborne 1998), while juvenile females remain near their natal areas; young remain with their mother until the start of the next breeding season (Hallager and Boylan 2004), and females with young typically remain in relatively small home ranges, e.g. 1.1-14.9 km2 in a study at Etosha National Park, Namibia (Osborne and Osborne 1998). The diet is catholic and includes various invertebrates (grasshoppers, locusts, beetles, armoured ground crickets, termites, caterpillars, solifuges, scorpions and snails), small vertebrates (lizards, chameleons, snakes, bird's eggs and nestlings, and small rodents) and a vegetable component (flowers, leaves, seeds, fruits, pods, roots, bulbs, wild melons, grass and vachellia (acacia) gum) (Chiweshe and Dale 1993, Allan and Osborne 2005). The species is a polygynous, solitary nester (Allan 1997f), with the breeding season lasting from July to April. A generation length of approximately 16 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014bz) although this is based on life history parameters of the extra-limital, but similar-sized Great Bustard, Otis tarda. </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is faced by multiple threats although habitat destruction would seem to be the highest concern (Anderson 2000h). Changes in land-use and habitat quality, e.g. through establishment of agricultural fields, overgrazing or bush encroachment, may lead to diminished food supplies, causing local extinction events (Allan 1997f, Anderson 2000h, Young et al. 2003), although the species is occasionally recorded in transformed habitats such as airstrips, fire-breaks, pastures, field and burnt areas. Collisions with overhead power-lines may be an underestimated threat (Martin and Shaw 2010), e.g. 22 birds were killed in five months along 10 kilometres of lines in the Karoo (van Rooyen 2000). The infestation of dry, tree-lined watercourses, a habitat frequented by bustards in the arid western regions, by alien invasive plants such as Prosopsis spp. has probably resulted in once suitable habitat type becoming unsuitable (Anderson 2000h). Other threats include poisoning, hunting for meat, trapping, stray dogs, droughts, human disturbance (especially during the sensitive nesting cycle) and, in the case of East African populations, wars and conflicts (Hallager and Boylan 2004). Birds are also known to be killed by entanglement in fences (DG Allan unpubl. data). The potential effects of climate change have not been fully investigated, but initial work indicates that clutches are fewer and smaller in dry years (Osborne 1998).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Gizzard content analysis has shown that birds may ingest artificial materials, e.g. bullet shells, metal, broken glass and plastic (RA Adam unpubl. data; TO Osborne and L Osborne unpubl. data), while in captivity the species has a tendency to swallow coins, batteries, nails and other artificial materials thrown into enclosures (Bailey and Hallager 2003); whether this has any adverse health effects is unknown, but it is probably a minor threat. Little is known about natural health and disease issues affecting the species, but captive birds have succumbed to a variety of diseases including Newcastle disease, avian pox and West Nile virus (Hallager 2010, Loomis 2013). Natural predators include Lion Panthera leo, Leopard P. pardus, Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus, Caracal Caracal caracal, and large raptors such as Tawny Eagle Aquila rapax, Verreauxs' Eagle A. verreauxii and Martial Eagle Polemaetus bellicosus, and African Rock Python Python sebae (Hallager and Boylan 2004).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is listed under Appendix II of CITES and is listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animals under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act No. 7 of 2003. Following a strategic workshop in 2009, the Bustard Working Group was established with the support of BirdLife South Africa, to assess the growing cause for concern over the conservation of South Africa's ten bustard and korhaan species. Valuable population data is generated through biannual censuses conducted via the Coordinated Avifaunal Roadcount Project. Given the increasing concern for survival of wild populations, captive breeding programmes are underway, notably in the USA, under the management of the Kori Bustard Species Survival Plan (SSP), a programme of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The Kori Bustard SSP has also produced an International Studbook for the Kori Bustard (Hallager 2010), which preserves detailed records on the numbers and demography of birds in captivity including current and historical population statistics, origins of captive birds, institutions holdings birds, captive reproductive parameters, fecundity and mortality statistics, age structures and health issues. Two institutions in South Africa currently have captive birds: one pair in Umgeni River Bird Park, and one pair in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens. The AZA's Kori Bustard SSP has also produced a Husbandry Manual (Hallager and Boylan 2004), which includes practical advice on management in captivity to zookeepers e.g. capture, handling and transport, enclosure specifications, recommended diet, population management and social organisation, health, veterinary care and reproduction and development. The SSP also produces an annual newsletter, The Gompou, which features updates on the aforementioned topics (available online through the Avian Scientific Advisory Group website, at www.aviansag.org). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Pending outcomes of research into the severity and extent of the multiple threats faced by this species, conservations efforts should probably be focused mainly on commercial farmland, rangelands and game ranches outside of formally protected areas, where Kori Bustards appear to have declined (Senyatso 2010). Education of the public and collaboration with private land-owners are key to establish and maintain beneficial land-management practices and eliminate hunting, persecution and disturbance. Given the great amount of research into husbandry practices and the well-established captive breeding programme in the United States of America, South African conservation agencies should investigate the possibility of starting a captive breeding programme locally, under the guidance of the Kori Bustard SSP, with the aim of re-introducing birds into suitable habitats within their former range. </p>

	<p class="Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Crithagra citrinipectus</p>
</div>

<div id="_idContainer1108" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Concerns for the conservation of the Lemon-breasted Canary Crithagra citrinipectus stem mainly from its globally restricted range. It is suspected to be in decline, approaching but not attaining the 30% threshold for qualification as Vulnerable. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was assessed as Near Threatened in the 2000 assessment and as Rare in the 1984 assessment. In addition it has undergone an apparent greater than 30% decline in AoO and is near-endemic to the region.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Barring taxonomic ‘splits', the Lemon-breasted Canary was the last new species to be described from southern Africa, from material collected near Panda, southern Mozambique (Clancey and Lawson 1960). Following recent analysis of mitochondrial DNA, it has been proposed that this species, along with various other small African canaries be placed in a separate genus, Ochrospiza, only distantly related to other African members of the present genus. The Lemon-breasted Canary is generally regarded as the eastern counterpart of the Black-throated Canary C. atrogularis, and the two taxa have mutually exclusive ranges. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">12 cm, 11 g. A tiny lowland canary. Sexes differ in plumage. Face greyish with dark grey malar stripe; supra-loral spot, spot at base of bill, and spot on ear coverts white or yellowish. Upperparts pale grey-brown with broad dark brown streaks. Male has diagnostic yellow breast patch, contrasting with white belly; breast buff in female. Flight feathers blackish-brown with wing bars showing flashes of white. Rump bright yellow. Tail tipped white (Berruti 1997e, Dean 2005e).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lemon-breasted Canary is an uncommon, highly localised near-endemic to the region. It is one of four species with global ranges of less than50 000 km2 defining the South-east African Coast Endemic Bird Area (Stattersfield et al. 1998). Its range is centred in Mozambique, which encompasses the majority of its global distribution, but it also extends to southern Malawi and the lowlands of south-eastern Zimbabwe. Within the region, it occurs in northern Zululand, from about St Lucia northwards, and marginally into the north-eastern portion of Kruger National Park (Allan 2000e). Its distribution is linked to that of the Lala Palm Hyphaene coriacea, a common tree in Maputaland where large stands of the palm grow almost to the exclusion of anything else. In the last two decades, the EoO of the Lemon-breasted Canary has contracted slightly (by c. 8%) to 54 589 km2 based on SABAP2 data. The contraction int its AoO has been more significant with a decline of c. 28% to 5 503 km2. Its numbers are variable at the same locality from year to year with movements probably being linked to irregular rainfall (Berruti 1997e). The species has been recorded from four IBAs including Kruger National Park, Kosi Bay System, Mkuze Game Reserve and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as local and uncommon within its limited range, although occasionally abundant (Clement et al. 1999), forming flocks of hundreds during suitable environmental conditions. Parker (1999) suspected that the population in southern Mozambique exceeds 50 000 birds. No population estimates exist for South Africa, but the number of birds in the region is certainly less than10 000 mature individuals. Confidence in this regional population estimate is low, and the status of the species requires further investigation.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be in overall decline owing to pressures on the palms with which it is strongly associated, plus trapping for the cage-bird trade (Allan 2000e, Clement et al. 1999). The utilisation of the Lemon-breasted Canary in the bird-trade is mentioned as far back as the early 1970s (Clancey 1971), while Parker (1999) noted that up to 2 000 birds are exported per year from southern Mozambique. A lack of population data complicates inferring a population trend. Although the AoO of the species has declined considerably between the two atlas periods, the relationship between a decline in AoO and concomitant decline in population size is not always linear. Furthermore the three-generation length of this species (11.4 years) is shorter than the time between atlas periods. It is unlikely that the species exceeds the 30% threshold, which would qualify it as regionally Vulnerable, but it may be approaching this level of decline. Confidence in the regional population trend estimate is low and requires verification. </p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is found in lowland palm savannah, clearings in dry woodland, Brachystegia scrub and grassland, invariably below 750 masl (Robson 1990). It appears to benefit from moderate levels of habitat modification, and is often common around rural gardens, road verges and edges of cultivation, for example. The species is a monogamous, solitary nester with breeding taking place from December to February (Tarboton 2011). Outside the breeding season it is gregarious, often forming nomadic flocks with Yellow-fronted Canary C. mozambica that wander in search of seeding grass (Hustler 1991). Nests are often placed in fronds of Lala Palms, and constructed largely with palm fibres.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lala Palm is one of the most economically important plants in Maputaland, supplying alcoholic wine, material for cane furniture and fibre, for domestic consumption and sale. Overexploitation may pose a threat to Lemon-breasted Canaries. Conversely, woodland clearing and small-scale agriculture probably provides additional habitat for the Lemon-breasted Canary. In neighbouring Mozambique, the collection of birds for the cage-bird trade is of concern; it is unknown whether this aconstitutes a threat in South Africa.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific measures are underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is reasonably represented in protected areas. Captive breeding, with the aim of re-introduction, may be a viable option for the Lemon-breasted Canary.</p>

	<h3>Research priorities and questions</h3>

</div>

<div id="_idContainer1118" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Crowned Cormorant Phalacrocorax coronatus does not meet the criteria for regionally Vulnerable. The regional population is relatively small (c. 1 900 breeding pairs) and the species would satisfy criterion C1 if the regional population shows a decline of 10% within the next 22 years (3 generations). While the regional population has fluctuated and even in&#173;creased over the past three generations, population trends should be carefully monitored in the near future. For these reasons, the species was listed as regionally Near Threatened. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of Crowned Cormorant falls within the region. It is a near-endemic species, occurring additionally along the coast of the southern half of Namibia. In addition, the species was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000 and globally Near Threatened in 2015. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species has been proposed to be placed within a different genus (out of a total of four genera in the Phalacrocoracidae), namely Microcarbo or ‘Micro-cormorants' (Siegel-Causey 1988, Christidis and Boles 2008). For the purposes of this assessment the genus Phalacrocorax is retained.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">54 cm; 790-730 g. A small coastal cormorant, with a small but distinctive frontal crest, usually held semi-erect. Sexes alike in plumage colouration but males slightly heavier. Body glossy black, except for short, white filoplumes on sides of face. Scapulars and upperwing coverts glossy grey-brown, with narrow blackish margins. Flight feathers and underwing black. Bill black, lower mandible with yellow-orange base; gape orange. Eyes ruby-red. Bare pink-red skin above and in front of eyes, swells and reddens during courtship. Legs and feet black. Non-breeding adult is overall paler and browner in colour (Crawford 2005d).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Crowned Cormorant is endemic to southern Africa, occurring on the coast as well as on islands from Möwe Bay, Namibia, to Tsitsikamma, South Africa (Crawford 2005d). Within the region it breeds at 11 locations including 10 islands and Lambert's Bay. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at c. 2 900 pairs with the regional population being estimated at c. 1 900 pairs in 2011 (Crawford et al. 2012a). Confidence in this regional population estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Based upon regular counts at breeding sites, the global population is stable. The number of cormorants breeding at ten localities in the region was stable from 1978/79 to 1990/91 before entering a period of fluctuation of between 800 to 1 200 pairs until 2002/03 (Kemper et al. 2007), before increasing sharply to the current population of 1 900 pairs. Confidence in the regional population trend is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Found on the coast and at sea mainly in inshore waters (less than5 km). Breeds mainly on islands and islets, where it builds elevated nests in trees, on old building roofs or walls, on old jetties, or atop high rocks and dolosses (Kemper et al. 2007). A generation length of 8.5 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014ca) although this is inconsistent with the generation length of 5 years provided by Kemper et al. (2007). The species forages benthically in inshore kelp beds, mainly on small, non-harvested fish including Clinidae and Gobiidae (Crawford et al. 2012b), as well as crustaceans, molluscs and polychaete worms (Williams and ?????r 1983). The species is not in competition with commercial fisheries (Crawford et al. 2012b).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Crowned Cormorant is extremely sensitive to human disturbance and will abandon its nest easily when approached, leaving contents to opportunistic predators such as Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus. Great White Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus are also known to take young chicks (Mwema et al. 2010) while African Sacred Ibises Threskiornis aethiopicus have been observed eating eggs on Malgas Island (TR Cook pers. obs). Cape Fur Seals Arctocephalus pusillus, which are increasing in numbers, are a threat to Cape Cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis and can kill up to 24% of all fledglings produced by a single breeding colony (Voorbergen et al. 2012). Predation on Crowned Cormorant fledglings is suspected, but has not been verified. Crowned Cormorants are probably limited by the availability of nesting habitat. Any reduction of accessible human artefacts, like walls, or of small trees or bushes would affect their capability to find adequate and sufficient nesting habitat. The species is very sensitive to oiling, as it depends on inshore kelp beds to forage and these are often directly affected during oil slicks.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Current conservation actions involve only full protection of breeding colonies, i.e. mainly islands, which fall under the jurisdiction of South African National Parks, CapeNature and Robben Island Nature Reserve. Lambert's Bay, Dassen, Dyer and Vondeling islands are Provincial Nature Reserves while Malgas, Marcus, Jutten, Schaapen, Meeuw and Caspian islands are part of the National Park system and listed as Ramsar sites. Robben Island is a World Heritage Site. Research is under way at the Percy FitzPatrick Institute and the Animal Demography Unit (University of Cape Town). This research involves mainly the study of the foraging strategies of Crowned Cormorants. </p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Crowned Cormorants are highly dependent on the inshore benthic zone for foraging. Full protection of the inshore marine environment within a radius of 5 km around breeding colonies should provide adequate food. The species has very specific nesting requirements and management should ensure that sufficient appropriate nesting sites are available and that there is limited human access to colonies. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Blue Crane Anthropoides paradiseus approached but did not satisfy the population-trend criterion for regionally Vulnerable (an estimated, population size reduction of greater than 30% over the past three generations where the reduction or its causes may not be reversible). The species is listed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is virtually endemic to the region with only a small sub-population occurring in northern Namibia. In addition, the Blue Crane was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The most recent phylogenetic study of cranes, using mitochondrial genome sequencing, maintains the Blue Crane in the genus Anthropoides (Krajewski et al. 2010). Monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">110 cm, 4.9 kg. Sexes are alike. Well-known as South Africa's national bird. A large, stately terrestrial species, with long tertial feathers forming a ‘train' trailing behind the bird. Body plumage silvery bluish grey, becoming darker on upper neck, lower half of head and nape. Feathers of crown and forehead greyish white, while cheeks, ear coverts and nape dark ashy grey; these feathers raised or fluffed during threat displays. Primaries black or slate-grey. Tertials greatly elongated; blackish. Bill short, and flesh-coloured. Eye dark brown. Legs and feet dark grey to black. Chicks are light brown while juveniles are slightly lighter blue-grey than adults, and lack elongated tertials (Allan 2005g).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Blue Crane, which is a near-endemic to South Africa, has the most restricted range of all crane species (Meine and Archibald 1996) with more than 99% of the global population occurring in the region (McCann et al. 2007), with a small population occurring in northern Namibia (Allan 2005g). The species is extinct in Swaziland with the last individuals disappearing from Malolotja Nature Reserve in 1995 and Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary in 1998 (Monadjem et al. 2003). In South Africa, Blue Cranes occur in three core areas: 1) the eastern grasslands, centred in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and north-eastern Free State provinces; 2) the central Karoo in the Northern Cape, southern Free State and Eastern Cape provinces; and 3) the Overberg and Swartland regions of Western Cape Province (McCann et al. 2007). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">McCann (2000) estimated the regional population to be c. 21 000 mature individuals. The most recent population estimate for the region is a minimum of 25 500 individuals, with 2 600 of these in the eastern grasslands, 10 800 in the central Karoo and 12 100 in Western Cape (McCann et al. 2007). The confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Blue Crane was listed as regionally Vulnerable in 2000 owing to a population decline of greater than 20% between 1978 and 1998 (McCann 2000). McCann (2000) estimated the population to be c. 21 000 mature individuals in 1988, indicating that the population in 1978 must have been in the order of 23 550 mature individuals. The most recent population estimate for the region is a minimum of 25 500 individuals, with 2 600 of these in the eastern grasslands, 10 800 in the central Karoo and 12 100 in Western Cape (McCann et al. 2007), representing an increase in the regional population of 18%. The cranes in the three core regions have had mixed fortunes, with SABAP2 data showing a continuation of earlier reported declines in the traditional grassland stronghold (McCann 2000). However, national aerial surveys, conducted by the Endangered Wildlife Trust and Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, indicate that the population in the Drakensberg regions of KwaZulu-Natal has increased by around 45% over the past decade (KL Morrison unpubl. data). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">While the central Karoo population has probably remained stable in this largely untransformed landscape, the Western Cape population has continued to expand and increase as Blue Cranes have adapted to the wheatland/pasture land-use systems (McCann et al. 2007). This suggests an increase in the regional population, although it cannot be discounted that the original estimates were, in fact, underestimates. Notwithstanding, the overall population is presumed to have declined by 15% over the past 39 years (three generations; BirdLife International 2014cb) until further evidence to support on-going stability and increases in local populations is obtained. The confidence in this regional population trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Blue Cranes are dry-grassland birds, found in open grassland habitats and ecotones between the Grassland and Nama Karoo biomes (Allan 2005h). They are also commonly found in agricultural landscapes, especially in Western Cape Province. Here they use a matrix of pastures and cereal croplands, moving seasonally between these habitats as food availability and visibility changes throughout the year (Allan 1995). Blue Cranes normally roost in wetlands or dams (Young et al. 2003). A generation length of 13 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014cb). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Loss of grassland habitat to afforestation, has been a major factor behind the significant decline in the Blue Crane population over the past few decades and was cited as one of the principle reasons for the demise of the species in Swaziland (Monadjem et al. 2003). Habitat loss through development, mining and the expansion of agriculture continues to impact this species. Poisoning also continues to pose a threat, but increased awareness has reduced deliberate poisoning, with most incidents now inadvertent. Collisions with overhead power-lines is currently thought to pose the greatest threat to Blue Cranes, with this bird the most commonly reported species found dead under the expanding power-line network. An estimated 12% of the Overberg population are killed annually by power-lines (Shaw et al. 2010b). Continued success of the growing Western Cape population is threatened by any future economic or climate driven changes to farming practices. Other threats to young cranes include drowning in water troughs, disturbance during harvest, predation by dogs, hunting and taking of birds for food (Allan 2005g, Monadjem et al. 2003).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Blue Cranes are mainly found on privately-owned farms and rangelands (Young et al. 2003), and so the key to their conservation lies in good relationships between land-owners and conservation agencies to ensure appropriate management of these environments. The African Crane Conservation Programme of the Endangered Wildlife Trust works on many aspects of Blue Crane conservation, including awareness and environmental education for land-owners, local communities and other stakeholders, reducing crane/farmer conflicts, community involvement in sustainable use and conservation of wetlands and grasslands, monitoring of crane populations, the trade in captive cranes, and work with Eskom to reduce power-line collisions. The species is listed under Schedule 2: Specially Protected Wild Animal under the Limpopo Environmental Management (Act No. 7 of 2003). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The evidence to date on the scale of Blue Crane mortality resulting from power-line collisions (Shaw et al. 2010b) highlights the urgent need for further research into this threat. So far, line-monitoring has been conducted only in localised areas, and expanding this will help to proactively identify collision hotspots. Experiments to test alternative mitigation solutions for collisions should be set up as soon as possible, as data collection can take several years. A new census of the Blue Crane population, and research into key demographic parameters (including the age of birds killed on power-lines), is crucial to understanding the impacts of collision mortality on populations. Such information will also allow more accurate population modelling to understand other threats, including the impacts of climate change. Further work to gauge the relative seriousness of threats facing the Blue Crane will help to prioritise conservation actions. Continued monitoring of crane populations, habitat conservation, input into EIA processes for new developments (particularly of power-lines, mines and wind farms), and land-owners and the public's awareness on various aspects of crane conservation are also essential.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Globally several key population of Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata are suspected to be undergoing moderately rapid population declines. This species is a non-breeding Palearctic migrant to the region, occurring in South Africa from September to March. Accordingly, the global status of this species is also adopted as the regional status. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Eurasian Curlew has a global status of Near Threatened and is a regular Paleartic migrant to the region. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Three subspecies are defined: the nominate arquata breeds in the western Palearctic and winters in north-west Africa; suschkini breeds in central Eurasia and winters along the African coast (possibly including in South Africa); and the eastern orientalis breeds from Siberia to China and migrates to eastern and southern Africa and parts of Asia (Engelmoer and Roselaar 2012, del Hoyo and Collar 2014).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">50-60 cm, 800 g. Female larger. A massive wader with an exceptionally long decurved bill. Head, neck and breast pale buffish brown with streaking. Mantle, upper back, scapulars and wing coverts dark greyish brown and heavily streaked. Lower back and rump white. Upper tail coverts and base of tail white with streaks. Belly whitish with pale brown streaking. Flanks heavily streaked. Bill dark brown with pinkish mandible. Legs and feet grey (Turpie 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Eurasian Curlew has a wide distribution across its Northern Hemisphere breeding grounds which spans from the British Isles, through north-western Europe and Scandinavia into Russia, extending east into Siberia (BirdLife International 2014cc). 75% of the global breeding population is found in northern Europe. With the exception of birds breeding in Britain and Ireland, the species is migratory, wintering across a broad front in the austral summer across the coasts of the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent, south-east Asia and Japan (Jensen and Lutz 2007). Within the region, birds are concentrated at larger wetlands along the coast with concentrations at Langebaan Lagoon, Western Cape (Turpie 2005b). It is suspected that birds occurring in South Africa breed east of the Urals, Russia (Underhill 1997) although this is unconfirmed. It is assumed that birds that remain throughout the austral winter are first-year birds (Underhill 1997).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated to number between 77 000-1 065 000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006) of which between 440 000-720 000 individuals are of the subspecies N. a. arguata which breeds across the British Isles, Fennoscandia and north and central European Russia (Stroud et al. 2004). The number of birds overwintering in South Africa and Namibia is c. 500 birds (Summers et al. 1987) although Taylor et al. (1999) reported a high of 1 370 birds at Langebaan Lagoon. Zwartkops Estuary is the only other site of significance with c. 60 individuals (Taylor 1999). The number of birds occurring in the austral summer is certainly greater than 1 000 mature individuals. Confidence in this regional estimate is low and requires verification.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of Eurasian Curlew is in decline with data from 2007 return estimated three-generation declines of between 26-34% (BirdLife International 2014cc). However, owing to the uncertainty over whether declines in southern populations have been compensated for by increases in northern populations, the global trend is suspected to fall within the band 20-30% in the past 15 years (three generations) accounting for its Near Threatened status (BirdLife International 2014cc). Confidence in this global population trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Eurasian Curlew is a wary species found mainly at large, relatively undisturbed estuaries or lagoons (Underhill 1997) and associated mudflats. It forages in loose flocks or singly, using its remarkable bill to probe, pick or feel for a variety of invertebrates, often in versatile, exploratory ways. Its diet consists of aquatic invertebrates including mud prawns, small crabs, shrimps, amphipods, bivalve molluscs, polychaete worms and occasionally small fish; inland, it also eats adult and larval insects, earthworms, woodlice, spiders and occasionally small vertebrates or vegetable matter (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Turpie 2005b). A generation length of five years is provided by BirdLife International (2014cc).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The most significant threats occur on the northern breeding grounds with changes in land-use, agricultural practices and nest predation considered to be responsible for declines in European Union states (Jensen and Lutz 2007). Habitat loss and modification has suppressed breeding success. Hunting is not considered to be a major cause for the decline in the European Union states; likewise, human disturbance on breeding and wintering areas is believed to be of secondary importance (Jensen and Lutz 2007).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation efforts are underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In 2007, the European Union Birds Directive completed a report on the Eurasian Curlew, which proposed management measures to be implemented in the 25 European member states although, ideally, management prescriptions of this plan should cover the entire geographical range of the Eurasian Curlew. The long-term objective (10 years) of the plan is to restore the species to a favourable conservation status. The short-term (three year) objectives are to (1) improve management and protection of breeding and wintering sites, (2) improve the protection from disturbance and (3) to collect more robust data to better understand the potential importance of hunting and other types of population regulations.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of Maccoa Duck Oxyura maccoa is listed as globally Near Threatened owing to perceived ongoing declines resulting from a variety of threats. It is not known if the perceived decline is sufficient for the species to qualify as globally Vulnerable. The regional assessment follows the global assessment. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is listed as globally Near Threatened. In addition, South Africa supports the largest national population (Berruti et al. 2005, Abebe et al. 2007) increasing the regional importance of the species.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Despite Scott and Rose (1996) defining three separate and isolated populations in the Ethiopian Highlands, East Africa and southern Africa, no subspecies are recognised. </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">48-51 cm, 600-800 g. A small, compact duck with a stiff tail often held erect. Sexes differ in plumage colouration. Breeding male has a dull black head extending to hind neck and throat. Lower neck, mantle, scapulars, back, rump and upper tail coverts chestnut. Tail blackish brown. Lower throat, sides of neck, breast, sides of body and flanks rich chestnut. Centre of breast and remainder of body greyish brown. Lacks a coloured speculum or wing bar. Eyes dark brown. Bill bright blue. Female much duller, with crown, nape and face of dark brown with a whitish streak below eye. Remainder of upperparts grey-brown, finely vermiculated and freckled greyish buff. Chin and throat whitish and remainder of underparts grey-brown. Bill dark brown. Juvenile resembles female but more uniform (Colahan 2005). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Maccoa Duck, despite having a large distribution, is a localised, relatively scarce species confined to several African states in three disjunct populations in the Ethiopian Highlands, East Africa and southern Africa (Scott and Rose 1996). The two northern populations include the countries of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania with the southern population being distributed across Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. The species is a vagrant to Swaziland (Parker 1994). Within the region, the species occurs in large numbers (391-700 individuals) at sites in Mpumalanga, Free State and Western Cape provinces with smaller numbers being recorded in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, Limpopo, North West, Northern Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The species is largely sedentary, making short post-breeding dispersals, presumably in response to changing environmental conditions (Clark 1964, Kear 2005) although these movements are not well understood (Abebe et al. 2007). Only c. 20% of the regional population occurs within protected areas (Berruti et al. 2005). The species is well represented in the regional IBA network, occurring at a total of 22 sites throughout the region. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated to be 9 000-11 750 individuals which translates to 6 000-7 900 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014cd) with the northern population consisting of c. 2 000-3 500 individuals and the southern population c. 7 000-8 250 individuals (Berruti et al. 2005, Abebe et al. 2007). Western Cape Province is estimated to have the highest number of birds (2 148) followed by Mpumalanga (1 125) and Free State (1 125) provinces with the remaining provinces contributing the balance (Abebe et al. 2007). The regional population is lower than previously thought (Abebe et al. 2007), presumably due to a lack of adequate data. The regional population is currently estimated to be between 4 500-5 500 individuals (Abebe et al. 2007). The confidence in this population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is decreasing although the exact rate of decline is unknown. The northern population has suffered perceived declines of up to 50% over the past 10 years (Abebe et al. 2007). The regional population is thought to be stable (Berruti et al. 2005) with populations increasing during the twentieth century due to the occupation of artificial impoundments in Namibia, Botswana and areas of South Africa (Abebe et al. 2007). Despite such increases there are no indications that this growth has continued and Abebe et al. (2007) mention that the trend may have been reversed with a regional decline underway, although the rate of decline is unknown. The confidence in the regional population trend estimate is high. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">During the breeding season, the Maccoa Duck prefers small, shallow and nutrient-rich inland freshwater lakes (Johnsgard and Carbonell 1996), although it also takes advantage of man-made infrastructure such as farm dams and sewage farms (Johnsgard and Carbonell 1996). Outside of the breeding season, the species will make use of larger sites with deeper water (Berruti et al. 2005). Breeding takes place from July through to April, with a peak in September to November (Johnsgard 1978). The timing of breeding is thought to be related to rainfall (Abebe et al. 2007). Nests are in emergent vegetation over deep water and, being attached to vegetation, are prone to flooding when water levels rise (Abebe et al. 2007). A poly&#173;gynous mating system is employed with males maintaining a territory with several females breeding simultaneously within that territory (Siegfried et al. 1976b). A generation length of six year is provided by BirdLife International (2014cd). Birds become more tolerant in the non-breeding season, congregating in large flocks (Kear 2005). Maccoa Ducks forage by diving and straining the benthic substrate through the bill, taking invertebrates and algae as well as the seeds and roots of wetland plants (Siegfried et al. 1976b). Dives can last 15-22 seconds (Macnae 1959) during foraging spells of 30-60 minutes (Siegfried et al. 1976b).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Key threats to the regional population are the draining of wetlands, pollution, alien vegetation and variable water levels (Abebe et al. 2007). Habitat loss, brought about by the drainage of wetlands and in particular smaller water bodies, which are used by the species for breeding, is a suspected key driver in declines. Pollution, which impacts on these ducks through bio-accumulation, is thought to be having an impact. Variable water levels threaten nests sites (Abebe et al. 2007). Lesser threats in South Africa include entanglement in gill nets, which was identified as a major threat for East African populations (Callaghan and Green 1993), the proliferation of alien vegetation, incidental disturbance through recreational usage of large water bodies, nest predation and poaching (Abebe et al. 2007). An indirect threat has resulted in the increased standard for water quality in the region. For instance, the improved treatment of sewage water at Strandfontein Sewage Work in Western Cape resulted in a decrease in the availability of food, resulting in a decrease from 500 individuals to less than50 at the site (Hockey et al. 1989). Botulism, which occurs on an infrequent basis, has resulted in mortalities of Maccoa Duck in the region. Hybridisation with escapee Ruddy Ducks O. jamaicensis, as well as competition with alien benthic-feeding fish, are perceived threats. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is listed under category 1C of the Africa-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement and under Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. An International Single Species Action Plan for the Conservation of Maccoa Duck has been compiled. The lead organisation responsible for the drafting of this document is the African Gamebird Research Education and Development Trust (AGRED). A workshop held in 2007 resulted in the formation of a Maccoa Duck Action Group with AGRED as coordinator. Provincial hunting regulations protects the species from hunting in the region.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">An inventory of Maccoa Duck sites as well as threats facing individual sites is urgently required. An annual count following a guideline document for population censusing and monitoring is required. The regional population estimate as well as possible rates of declines needs to be ascertained. Key wetland sites need to be protected with an aim to reducing the loss of available breeding habitat. Provincial conservation agencies need to be made aware of threats that entanglement with gill nets poses to Maccoa Duck, and laws against gill netting enforced at key sites. Measures need to be put in place to prevent disturbance at key breeding sites. The correct management of water levels at key breeding sites based upon ecological reserve determination studies is required.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of Red-footed Falcon Falco vespertinus is listed as Near Threatened due to perceived moderately rapid population declines, owing to habitat loss and degradation. A very large portion of the global population occurs within the region in the austral summer although the number of birds is unknown. The global listing is therefore adopted, and the species is assessed as regionally Near Threatened. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Virtually the entire global population of the Red-footed Falcon, which is listed as globally Near Threatened, migrates to southern African in the austral summer (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">28-30 cm, 155-170 g. A small, gregarious falcon that hunts in open landscapes and roosts communally in tall trees. Sexes  differ in plumage colouration, and female is slightly larger. Male predominantly dark blue-grey, darkest on head, mantle, upperwing coverts and tail. Vent rufous. Eyes dark brown, surrounded by fleshy reddish ring. Bill base and cere orange, tip dark. Legs and feet orange-red. Female has slaty-grey mantle and scapulars, featuring darker barring. Underparts mostly ginger-buff, sometimes with brown streaking. Throat and ear coverts whiter. Dark mask around eye, forming short malar stripe. Head brown. Tail and flight feathers whitish, with prominent grey bars. Bare parts as in male. Juvenile similar to female, but shows heavier streaking on underparts (Jenkins 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Red-footed Falcon is a Palearctic migrant whose breeding range extends from Central and Eastern Europe through northern Central Asia westwards as far east as Lake Baikal, Russia (Palatitz et al. 2009). The southern limit of the breeding range passes through Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, southern Russia and northern Kazakhstan (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Purger 2008). It migrates south in the austral summer across a broad front, with Botswana, northern Namibia and southern Angola being the main wintering grounds (Mendelsohn and Herremans 1997). Within the region it prefers large, open, grassy spaces in arid woodland, such as are found in the western portions of South Africa (Mendelsohn and Herremans 1997), where it is present from October to November, with numbers peaking in January to February. It is relatively uncommon and is prone to localised movements in response to rainfall and resultant insect irruptions (Mendelsohn and Herremans 1997). In the eastern parts of South Africa, the species is often overlooked amongst flocks of Lesser Kestrels F. naumanni and Amur Falcons F. amurensis. Departs for the breeding grounds in April, arriving in natal areas from late May onwards.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species has a large global population estimated to be between 300 000 and 800 000 mature individuals (Palatitz et al. 2009). The number of birds visiting the region in the austral summer is unknown: while the vast majority of the world population spends the non-breeding season in southern Africa (particularly Botswana, northern Namibia, and southern Angola), the species is relatively uncommon within South Africa's borders, where it is greatly outnumbered by other small falcons (Mendelsohn and Herremans 1997).Confidence in the global population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Recent evidence suggests that the global population is in decline (Palatitz et al. 2009). The European population of 26 000-39 000 pairs suffered a decline during 1970-1990 while further declines have been reported from Russia, Ukraine, eastern Siberia, Hungary and Bulgaria (Purger 2008, Palatitz et al. 2009). The declining global population is thought to be approaching the 30% threshold, which would require the uplisting of the species to globally Vulnerable. Confidence in this trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Red-footed Falcon is highly gregarious, and is usually seen in flocks of 10-50 birds in open country (Mendelsohn and Herremans 1997). It is a generalist predator that typically hunts on the wing but will also take prey from the ground (Mendelsohn and Herremans 1997). Its diet consists primarily of arthropods, including insects, centipedes, solifugids and occasionally small vertebrates. The species is a non-breeding visitor to Africa, but on its Eurasian breeding grounds it is a facultative colonial breeder making use of a variety of nesting opportunities such as Rook Corvus frugilegus colonies, Hooded Crow Corvus corone cornix and buzzard Buteo spp. nests, as well as cavities in trees. In certain areas of the breeding range (e.g. Hungary) up to 60% of the population breeds in nest boxes (Palatitz et al. 2009). The species roosts communally, congregating in large numbers around traditional roosts (typically tall alien trees in rural towns) at dusk. A generation length of 5.7 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014ce).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to the Red-footed Falcon on its breeding grounds is habitat loss and modification which drives a loss of nest sites (Palatitz et al. 2009). Agricultural intensification that has taken place in the western parts of its breeding range has led to significant loss of grasslands associated with the decline of traditional livestock husbandry (Böhning-Gaese and Bauer 1996). This, along with the cultivation of intertilled crops such as maize and sunflower, has reduced the suitable foraging habitats of the species, making its hunting technique less effective (Fehérvári et al. 2009). Declines can be partly attributed to a reduction in the Rook population between 1980-2006, limiting the availability of nest sites to Red-footed Falcons. Illegal shooting occurs during their migration (Palatitz et al. 2009). Threats to the species across its non-breeding grounds remain poorly known although the majority of threatened Palearctic migrants are limited by the quantity and quality of available habitat in non-breeding areas (Kirby et al. 2008) and it is likely that Red-footed Falcon is similarly affected. Small falcons that use roadside telephone and electricity wires as hunting perches are frequently killed by vehicles. The species' habit of roosting communally in localised large trees makes it inherently vulnerable; such trees are often alien species situated in rural towns, where the birds may be seen as a nuisance and their roost trees felled.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A European Species Action Plan for the Red-footed Falcon was completed in 2009 (Palatitz et al. 2009). The species is listed under Category 1 of the Conservation of Migratory Birds of Prey in Africa and Eurasia 1979. No species-specific conservation measures are currently underway within the region, although the different regional awareness projects of the Endangered Wildlife Trust's Birds of Prey Working group would benefit this species. Currently the Endangered Wildlife Trust's Migratory Kestrel Project focuses mainly on counting and conservation of Lesser Kestrel and Amur Falcon at their roost trees; this project should be expanded to include Red-footed Falcons, possibly in partnership with the established regional network of BirdLife South Africa branches. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES Proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Efforts to conserve migratory birds in a portion of their range are less effective if unaddressed threats are reducing these species' populations and habitats elsewhere (Kirby et al. 2008). While the threats to the Red-footed Falcon across its southern African non-breeding grounds remain poorly known and largely undocumented (Palatitz et al. 2009), it is essential that an effort is made by local conservation groups, through collaboration with northern hemisphere counterparts, to obtain a firmer understanding of the threats and to address them. Local conservation measures would flow from the results of research questions listed here, but could also include a register of roost trees that are utilised by this species, which should be earmarked for protection. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The southern African population of Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus has undergone declines of greater than 40% over the past three generations. Unfortunately, there are no data to support similar trends within the regional population although it is suspected to be approaching the 30% threshold qualifying this species as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater Flamingo was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000, with no known recent improvement in population status or reduction of threats.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Considerable debate has taken place as to whether Old and New World races of Greater Flamingo should be split (Sangster 1997); if split, the latter is recognised as American Flamingo P. ruber of the Caribbean and northern South America, while Greater Flamingo P. roseus is restricted to Africa, parts of the Palearctic and India.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">145-165 cm, 2.6-3.5 kg. A very large, pale flamingo with a diagnostic dark bill tip. Plumage pale pink, upperwing coverts bright crimson, underwing coverts pink, and flight feathers black. Bill pale mauve, tipped black. Immature similar but with greyer body plumage and lower mandible. Juvenile dark grey-brown (Simmons 2005h).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Widely distributed in Africa and the southern Palearctic (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Occurs in southern Europe and east across the Arabian Peninsula and Iran to south-east Asia. In Africa, found along the North and West African coasts to Senegal in the west, and south along the Red Sea Coast and Rift Valley to coastal Angola and South Africa (Brown et al. 1982). Fairly widespread in southern Africa, where common on central plateau; common along the West Coast where it is frequently recorded at estuaries and other coastal wetlands, but rare on the East Coast (Williams and Velásquez 1997a, Simmons 2005h). It is a vagrant to Swaziland (Parker 1994) and a potential vagrant to Lesotho (Osborne and Tigar 1990). In South Africa, important numbers have been recorded at the following wetlands: Lake St Lucia (KwaZulu-Natal), Leeupan/Barberspan (North West), Kamfers Dam (Northern Cape) and Langebaan Lagoon, Strandfontein Sewage Works and the Berg River Estuary (Western Cape) (Taylor 1999, Anderson 2000i, 2000j). The Greater Flamingo has probably benefited from an increase in human-made habitats, such as salt works, sewage works and large impoundments.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been estimated at c. 800 000 birds (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The African population was estimated at 165 000 in 1975 (Kahl 1975), decreasing to 85 000 in the mid-1990s. The most recent estimate is 115 000 in 2005 (Simmons 2005h). These suggested decreases are in contrast to the increasing populations in Europe (Johnson and Durand 2001). The resident population in southern Africa has been estimated at 50 000-60 000 birds (Dodman and Taylor 1995, Simmons 1996, Simmons 2005h), but up to 40 000 pairs have been recorded breeding on occasion at Sua Pan, Botswana, (McCulloch 2001) and up to 27 000 pairs at Etosha Pan, Namibia (Berry 1972). Has successfully bred at Sua Pan during recent years, with the following numbers of breeding pairs: 16 761 (2007/8), 36 986 (2008/9), 15 695 (2009/10) and 13 465 (2010/11) (G McCulloch pers. comm.). Large numbers have been reported at times in southern Africa, such as 650 000-1 000 000 birds at Lake Ngami in 1971 and c. 300 000 birds at Makgadikgadi in 1974 (Dawson and Jacka 1975). Movements within the region are erratic and largely driven by environmental conditions such as rainfall resulting in difficulties in providing an estimate of the number of birds in the region at any one time. No regional population estimate is available.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is on the increase, although this is largely driven by growth in the European population (BirdLife International 2014cf). Simmons (1996) suggested a 40% decline in the population of Greater Flamingos in southern Africa during the 1980s to mid-1990s, attributable to low recruitment (Simmons 1996) and soda ash and salt mining at breeding localities (Connor 1980, Aves 1992). Unfortunately no recent population trends for the region are available, but previously suggested threats persist which may indicate that the southern African population is continuing to decline. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the regional population and no data are available to support a population trend. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Greater Flamingo occurs in large flocks of up to tens of thousands, often with Lesser Flamingos Phoeniconaias minor. Movements take place mostly at night, and in response to inundation of ephemeral pans (Simmons 2005h). Little is known regarding regional movements, but apparent large influxes from East Africa occur during the breeding season, particularly to Sua Pan, Botswana (McCulloch and Borello 1998). Feeds on brine shrimps, brine flies, molluscs and diatoms by wading in water, bill upside down, filtering food from mud (Simmons 2005h). Main breeding sites in southern Africa are Etosha Pan and Sua Pan, but occasionally breeds at a number of smaller wetlands in South Africa (Anderson 2000i, 2000j), although these breeding attempts are often unsuccessful (Simmons 2005h). Most of the recruitment to the South African population originates from Sua Pan. Breeding has been successful in South Africa at Lake St Lucia (Porter and Forrest 1974), De Hoop Vlei, Bredasdorp (Uys et al. 1961, 1963) and several wetlands in the Northern Cape (Boshoff 1979, Anderson 2000i). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is a colonial nester, with hundreds to thousands of nests per colony. It breeds in summer, after breeding areas are flooded. Usually one egg is laid; very rarely two. Chicks leave the nest after 5-10 days and join large crèche, often with Lesser Flamingos. Breeding success is extremely variable (Uys et al. 1963, Porter and Forrest 1974, McCulloch and Irvine 2004, Simmons 2005h) with only five out of 17 attempts at Etosha Pan successful (Simmons 1996, Simmons 2005h). A generation length of 16.3 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014cf).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Threats include soda-ash mining around the main breeding site at Sua Pan, collisions with fences and overhead power-lines in South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and lowered water tables around the feeder rivers to Etosha Pan (Williams and Velásquez 1997a, Simmons 2005h). Hot-air balloons, low-flying aircraft, Marabou Storks Leptoptilos crumeniferus and raptors can cause nest desertion and subsequent failure of breeding attempts. (Berry 1972, Brown et al. 1982, Simmons 2005h). Rapidly declining water levels reduce food supplies and increase predation risk, leading to mass mortality as well as failure of breeding attempts (Berry 1972, Fox et al. 1997, Simmons 2005h).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Greater Flamingo has successfully bred on an artificial island in France (Johnson 1989), with similar structures being proposed but not implemented in southern Africa (Simmons 1996). About 100 chicks were produced in 2009/2010, on a purpose-built S-shaped island constructed in Kamfers Dam, Kimberley to encourage breeding in Lesser Flamingos (Anderson and Anderson 2010).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Key feeding and breeding sites should be identified, protected and monitored. Anthropogenic threats need to be addressed, including marking of power-lines with suitable marking devices to prevent nocturnal collisions. The reconstruction of the Kamfers Dam Lesser Flamingo breeding island would also benefit Greater Flamingos.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lesser Flamingo Phoeniconaias minor is classified as globally Near Threatened due to a perceived decline in population numbers. In addition, a proposed large-scale soda ash extraction at Lake Natron in Tanzania, the most important breeding colony, although currently on hold, poses a serious threat to the species and would qualify the species for up-listing to a higher threat category. In southern Africa, an apparent decrease of c. 27% between the mid-1970s and 1994 indicates that the regional population trend mirrors that of the global population, approaching the threshold for Vulnerable under criterion A2. The species is assessed as regionally Near Threatened in line with its global status.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Lesser Flamingo was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000 and globally Near Threatened in 2013. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">113-122 cm, 1.6-1.8 kg. The smaller and darker pink of Africa's two flamingos. Males larger. Plumage pink, but paler when not breeding. Juvenile birds smaller than adults, and brownish grey; immature birds smaller and whiter than non-breeding adults. Bill deep crimson to maroon, tipped black, and appears all-black at a distance. Bill of juveniles and immature dark grey-black, turning dark maroon when reaching adulthood (Simmons 2005i).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lesser Flamingo occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, with high densities at  the Great Rift Valley Lakes of East Africa and in southern Africa (Brown et al. 1982, Simmons 2000b). There is a small coastal population in West Africa (Simmons 2000b) and additional small populations on the Arabian Gulf Coast, India and Pakistan (Mundkur 1997). Until recently, the only regular breeding sites in Africa were Lake Natron, Tanzania, Etosha Pan, Namibia and Sua Pan, Botswana (Berry 1972, Hancock and Liversedge 1990, Simmons 1996, Simmons 1997d, McCulloch and Irvine 2004). During four consecutive years, from 2007 to 2011, Lesser Flamingos bred on a purpose-built, S-shaped, 25x250 m island constructed at Kamfers Dam, just north of Kimberley (Northern Cape, South Africa) (Anderson 2008, Anderson and Anderson 2010). An estimated 24 000 chicks were produced during these breeding events, representing the only documented incident of successful breeding in South Africa. The island flooded in the summer of 2011/2012 and no breeding has subsequently taken place (Anderson and Anderson 2012). At least 12 breeding attempts at sites in South Africa have been unsuccessful (Uys and Macleod 1967, Brooke 1984), mainly because the sites are small, with low numbers of flamingos, and therefore unsuitable for mass breeding (Simmons 1996, Simmons 1997d).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lesser Flamingo's non-breeding distribution in South Africa is centred on the central Highveld, but it also occurs along the West and South coasts (Borello et al. 1998). Large numbers have been recorded at Lake St Lucia, KwaZulu-Natal (IBA SA058), Berg River (IBA SA104), Wadrif Saltpan and Langebaan Lagoon (IBA SA105) in Western Cape, and Kamfers Dam, Northern Cape (IBA SA032) (Taylor 1999). It is a vagrant to Swaziland (Parker 1994) and a potential vagrant to Lesotho (Osborne and Tigar 1990). A satellite telemetry study of individuals from their breeding site at Sua Pan, Botswana identified their migration to non-breeding feeding grounds in South Africa and Mozambique, suggesting their reliance on a wide variety of small wetlands and coastal areas in the region during the non-breeding season (McCulloch et al. 2003). In excess of one million non-breeding Lesser Flamingos have been observed at Etosha Pan (Berry 1972) and Sua Pan (Parker 1975). The large influxes of birds in southern Africa coincide with decreases in East Africa, which suggests movements between these two populations (Simmons 1996). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been estimated at 2-6 million individuals (Kahl 1975, Brown et al. 1982, Simmons 2000b), with c. four million occurring in Africa (Simmons 1997d). The most recent estimate calculates the population to number 865 000-2 640 000 individuals (mean 1 752 500) (Childress et al. 2008). The southern African population has previously been estimated at 55 000 (Cooper and Hockey 1981), 60 000 (Williams and Velásquez 1997b) and 40 000 (Simmons 1996, Simmons 1997d). It is possible that these were underestimates, largely due to the difficulty of counting large aggregations, their dispersion at remote wetlands across southern Africa, their frequent movements between feeding sites, and their use of isolated areas of the larger feeding and breeding sites. Large numbers of Lesser Flamingos have also recently been recorded breeding at Sua Pan, including 64 287, 90 690 and 44 731 pairs in 1999/2000, 2005/2006 and 2008/2009 respectively (McCulloch and Irvine 2004). </p>
	<h2>TREND justification </h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is decreasing owing to habitat degradation and disturbance, although some populations may be stable and others have unknown trends, thus a moderately rapid decline is suspected overall (Delany and Scott 2006). Simmons (1996, 1997d) suggested that the southern African population had decreased from the early-1980s to the mid-1990s by about 15 000 birds or 27%. Simmons (1996) attributed this population decline to poor recruitment brought about by infrequent breeding at Etosha Pan and Sua Pan. It is unknown whether this suggested population trend has continued although consistent successful breeding events at Sua Pan between 2000 and 2012 may have resulted in an improved recruitment rate in recent times (McCulloch unpubl. data). Confidence in the regional trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lesser Flamingo occurs on open, eutrophic, shallow saline and alkaline wetlands, such as salt pans and coastal lagoons and estuaries (Brown et al. 1982, Williams and Velásquez 1997b). Lesser Flamingos are colonial nesters, with colonies numbering tens of thousands (Simmons 2005i). Nest turrets of varying height are constructed on flooded pans (Berry 1972). Breeding takes place usually during the summer months after pans are inundated, but may extend into winter (Simmons 1996). One egg is laid, very rarely two (Berry 1972). Chicks leave the nest at c. six days old, and join crèches. Breeding success depends upon the extent and period of flooding around the breeding colonies, which affords the eggs and chicks sufficient protection from raptors and mammalian predators such as Brown Hyena Parahyaena brunnea and Black-backed Jackal Canis mesomelas (McCulloch and Irvine 2004). On Sua Pan, chick mortality rapidly increases as the pan dries up owing to predation (McCulloch and Irvine 2004). Chick crèches move long distances (up to 60 km) from the nesting sites to find refuge in water bodies elsewhere on the drying pan. Adults will abandon the chicks only when the pan dries up completely, in years of below average rainfall. Sexual maturity reached at 3-4 years. There are insufficient data to estimate annual mortality and survival (Childress et al. 2008). A generation length of 15.5 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014cg). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lesser Flamingo feeds by wading in shallow water, with bill upside-down, filtering cyanobacteria from the water surface, and small diatoms from bottom layers (Berry 1972). At Sua Pan, for example, large flocks congregate along the shallow edges of the flooded pan, filtering an algal mix of predominantly Oscillatoria: a filamentous blue-green algae and diatoms from the mud surface (G McCulloch, unpubl. data). It occurs in large flocks, often with Greater Flamingos (Berry 1972). When moving between water bodies, Lesser Flamingos often fly in ‘V'-shaped skeins of thousands of birds, usually at night (Simmons 2005i).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The most critical threat to the survival of the Lesser Flamingo is degradation of its specialised breeding and feeding habitats through altered hydrology and water quality, wetland pollution, extraction of salt and soda ash, and the disruption of its few breeding colonies by human activities (Childress et al. 2008) In South Africa, the threats include disturbance by low-flying aircraft, collisions with fences and utility lines, fluctuating water levels, salt extraction, pollution of wetlands and human interference (Connor 1980, Hall 1983, Brooke 1984, Aves 1992, Simmons 1996, 1997d, Hill et al. 2013) Flamingos may be attracted to wet roads and runways, which are perceived to be wetlands by overflying birds and it is therefore not certain whether the development of large solar farms in South Africa will affect Lesser Flamingos. A housing estate proposed for development on a property adjacent to Kamfers Dam was considered to be a potential threat to the dam's flamingos. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Avian predators such as eagles, vultures and Marabou Storks Leptoptilos crumeniferus take chicks and adults and constant harassment causes colony abandonment in East Africa. Disturbance by low-flying aircraft may result in colony desertion (RE Simmons and R Braby pers. obs.). Occasional mass die-offs take place in East Africa, possibly due to avian tuberculosis (Kock et al. 1999), but this has not been recorded in southern Africa (Simmons 2005i). Avian pox virus has recently been documented in South Africa (Zimmermann et al. 2011), and its spread could be exacerbated by deteriorating water quality and proliferation of biting insects at wetlands frequented by Lesser Flamingos. Threats to breeding birds in Namibia and Botswana include soda ash and salt mining (Simmons 1996, Simmons 1997d) resulting in a lowering of water table. At Sua Pan the main threats include disturbance of the breeding colony by low-flying aircraft, filming and tourism and the potential damming of the Nata and Mosetse rivers, while groundwater abstraction by mining in the surrounding watershed threatens the flood period of the pan around the breeding site (McCulloch, unpubl. data). Threats in Namibia include pesticide use, increasing human populations in northern catchments, and lowered water tables in eastern catchments reducing water inflow to Etosha Pan. Some breeding sites may be threatened by the damming of feeder rivers, particularly at Lake Natron in Kenya, and possibly also the Nata River into Sua Pan. Neither of these sites have national park status.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There is varying protection of the feeding sites, from IBA status (Kamfers Dam), Ramsar status (Orange River Mouth) to formal protection (Lake St Lucia). Efforts are underway by the Save the Flamingo Association to address water quality threats at Kamfers Dam, with recent success. Collision of flamingos with power-lines and telephone lines are not adequately addressed, partly because of the unavailability of suitable marking devices to make cables more visible at night. Marking devices are currently being tested by Eskom and the Endangered Wildlife Trust. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The recommendations in the International Single Species Action Plan for the Conservation of the Lesser Flamingo (Childress et al. 2008) must be implemented. In southern Africa, any current and potential threats to Etosha Pan and Sua Pan, the two southern African breeding sites, must be addressed and these pans must be protected and maintained in good ecological condition. In South Africa, the Kamfers Dam breeding island should be reconstructed and this wetland should be formally protected. Management plans for wetlands where large numbers of Lesser Flamingos occur, such as Kamfers Dam and Flamingo Pan, Welkom should be developed, especially to ensure that water quality issues and human disturbance issues are addressed. Key feeding sites should be identified, protected and monitoring programmes implemented. Alternative sites, such as the Welkom pans, should be considered for the construction of artificial breeding islands. Overhead cables, which result in mortalities through collisions, should be marked with suitable devices. Disturbance by low-flying aircraft must be prevented through legislation, planning, zoning and enforcement.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Pallid Harrier Circus macrourus is a globally Near Threatened Palearctic migrant to the region. Known population declines are attributed primarily to threats faced on its breeding grounds in the Northern Hemisphere, but mortalities sustained during migration and on its African wintering grounds have recently been highlighted. The global status of Near Threatened is adopted as the regional status.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this species occurs within the region. Pallid Harrier is currently listed as globally Near Threatened and was listed as Near Threatened in the 2000 regional assessment.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">40-48 cm, 310-440 g. A scarce migratory harrier of grassland and sparse savannah. Adults show marked sexual dimorphism. Adult male pale grey above and mostly white below, with a pale grey chest and throat. Upperwing pale grey, and underwing white; on both surfaces shows distinct black wedge formed by dark outer primaries. Bill grey with yellow cere. Legs, feet and eye are bright yellow. Adult female mostly dark brown with paler, rufous-streaked underparts. Throat white. Upperparts darker brown. Feathers around face creamy-white with dark lores and ear coverts. Upperwing coverts and flight feathers dark brown. Undersides of primaries barred grey and white; underside of secondaries barred dark grey. Tail is light brown with 4-5 dark bands. The juvenile is superficially similar to adult female but more rufous below with less streaking (Simmons 2005j). Males can be distinguished from the sympatric Montagu's Harrier C. pygargus given a sufficient view, but females and juveniles of the two species are very difficult to distinguish.</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Pallid Harrier is a Palearctic migrant that breeds from the Volga River, eastwards through the Urals, southern Siberia, northern Kazakhstan and north-western China (Terraube et al. 2009). It migrates south in the austral summer to the Indian subcontinent and open woodlands and grasslands of eastern and central Africa (Terraube et al. 2012). However, a number of birds do move as far south as southern Africa. Within the region the species occurs across the eastern half of the country, but there are no notable strongholds anywhere except Kruger National Park. Higher densities mapped around Gauteng are almost certainly just a reflection of more observers in that region. The species is represented in a number of IBAs, but is probably at best a sparse, transient visitor to such areas. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at 9 000-15 000 pairs (Galushin et al. 2003). Reliable population estimates of the species on its migration routes and wintering grounds are difficult to obtain primarily due to the rarity of the species, its broad-front migration strategy and difficulties in field identification (Galushin et al. 2003). Simmons (2005j) believes it unlikely that more than 500 birds visit southern Africa in the austral summer. Confidence in the global population estimate is low, and population estimates need to be quantified.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is known to be undergoing a steep decline in Europe while declines in its Asiatic strongholds thought to be mirroring that of Europe although not as steep (BirdLife International 2014ch). However, the reliability of Asian population estimates is not high, and population monitoring is further complicated by the extreme nomadism of this species (Terraube et al. 2012). These population declines are not recent, with Davygora and Belik (1994) reporting declines at the western limits of the species' range, with populations in Asia, although less well documented, also in decline (Davygora and Belik 1994). A large decline occurred in Europe during 1970-1990 when up to 30% of the population was lost (Tucker et al. 1994). The species continued to decline between 1990-2000, with overall trends exceeding the 30% threshold over three generations (18 years) (BirdLife International 2014ch). Steyn (1982) who observed that ‘the species was formerly common but is now rarely seen', reported these declines as far back as 1982. Confidence in the global trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Pallid Harrier prefers dry to damp grasslands associated with open pans or floodplains, or open areas in woodland where it hunts by flying for long distances, generally keeping 1-5 metres above the ground. Rodents are the preferred prey, both during the breeding season (Terraube et al. 2009, 2012) and in winter (Buij et al. 2012), although it will catch prey such as insects and birds (Simmons 2000a). Breeding is extra-limital and occurs in a variety of different habitats including steppe, riverine and agricultural landscapes (Terraube et al. 2009). Breeding numbers and success are dependent on rodent abundance and distribution (Terraube et al. 2012). A generation length of 7.9 years is provided based upon the mean of two calculated values derived from published and extrapolated estimates of mean age at first breeding, maximum longevity in the wild and mean annual adult survival (BirdLife International 2014ch). When wintering in the northern hemisphere, it often roosts communally with other harriers in large numbers (Clark 1993) but communal roosts are unknown in southern Africa. </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Declines have been attributed to habitat destruction and degradation, reduction in prey availability and contamination by toxic pesticides on breeding and wintering areas (Davygora and Belik 1994, Terraube et al. 2009). Within the region, poisoning, destruction of grassland and pan systems, and persecution are suspected to have contributed to the global population declines (Barnes 2000p). Conversely, the species may have benefited from the large-scale clearance of forested areas in the Palearctic. The fragmentation of most suitable habitats (open areas with natural vegetation) highlights the Pallid Harrier's vulnerability to current land-use changes in Africa and associated loss of natural vegetation. Mortality during migration and on wintering areas is also a significant threat, in particular illegal hunting on the migratory pathways or habitat degradation in stopover areas (Terraube et al. 2012). The widespread capture and shooting of raptors, including harriers, have been reported on migration corridors in Georgia, along the Black Sea Coast and in several Middle East countries (van Maanen et al. 2001). Although comprehensive information is lacking, anecdotal evidence indicates that migratory birds are facing considerable hunting and trapping pressure. Priority should be given to assessing the sensitivity of Pallid Harriers to illegal hunting along the migration routes (Terraube et al. 2012).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A species action plan focusing on the management of the global population was compiled in 2002 (Galushin et al. 2003). Although no regional species-specific conservation measures are underway for this species (RE Simmons pers. comm.), the species is protected under international agreements that South Africa is party to, as well as national and provincial legislation. The species is listed under Category 1 of the Conservation of Migratory Birds of Prey in Africa and Eurasia Agreement of 1979. In addition, it is listed as Endangered under the National Environmental Management Act: Biodiversity Act 10 of 2004 and is ‘Fourth schedule: Specially Protected' under the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Management Amendment Act No 5 of 1999.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Extensive recommendations have been made for the species within its northern hemisphere range including the conservation of wetlands and ponds in typical steppe grassland and semi-desert environments, the encouragement of moderate grazing programmes, research into diet and foraging range size, and their role in the movement of populations. Within the region, it is essential that pesticides, harmful to this raptor species, be banned from use and that full legal protection is extended to the Pallid Harrier.</p>

	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Three races have been described, with the South African nominate race replaced by the smaller A.s.tephria north of the Limpopo and Save rivers while A.s. heuglini, is  restricted to Ethiopia (Fry et al. 1988, Turpie 2005c). The species is now generally considered monotypic (Gill and Donsker 2015).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">18 cm, 35-40 g. A medium-sized, brilliant blue water-associated kingfisher. Could be confused with juvenile Malachite Kingfisher Alcedo cristata. Sexes differ slightly in bill colour: all-black in males but red-based in females. Crown bright cobalt blue, barred black. Nape dark ultramarine blue, contrasting with brilliant azure blue back and rump. Uppertail coverts darker blue. Tail dark blue. Ear coverts blue, offset against large white blaze on side of neck. Lores darker, bordered above by narrow white patch. Throat white, grading to pale orange on breast and rich orange on belly, flanks and undertail coverts; large blue patch on side of breast. Scapulars and wing coverts dark greenish blue. Remiges black, edged green-blue. Eyes dark brown. Legs and feet vermillion red. Juvenile similar to adult, but paler orange below and breast sometimes with faint with dusky barring (Fry et al. 1988, Turpie 2005c). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, occurring in three isolated sub-populations (but with some records of vagrants in intervening areas), namely Ethiopia, north-western Tanzania, and south-central Africa. In the latter region, it occurs from southern Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and Angola southwards to northern Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa. Surprisingly, it is absent from the Okavango Delta in Botswana, but it does occur on the Kavango River in Namibia (Clancey and Herremans 1997). In Zimbabwe it is restricted to the northern and eastern parts of the country, contiguous with the population in central Mozambique; in southern Mozambique it historically occurred sparingly on the streams of Lebombo Mountains near the Swaziland border (Clancey 1996), but was not recorded south of the Save River by Parker (1999). It avoids the Limpopo Valley, corresponding to the border between the South African nominate subspecies and the northerly subspecies tephria (Clancey and Herremans 1997). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Within the region, the Half-collared Kingfisher is widespread but generally sparsely distributed throughout high-rainfall areas of the east and extreme south (Fry et al. 1988, Allan 2000d). Atlas data indicate strongholds in the Bushveld-Highveld interface in Gauteng, the Mpumalanga/Swaziland Escarpment region, uplands of KwaZulu-Natal and coastal zones in Eastern Cape (Tarboton et al. 1987, Clancey and Herremans 1997). In Western Cape it is rare west of George, but is occasionally recorded as far as Cape Town and the Cederberg. It may occur marginally in Lesotho, but is generally absent from that country, despite being relatively common in adjacent areas of the Drakensberg in KwaZulu-Natal and the eastern Free State. SABAP2 data suggests an AoO of c. 109 000 km2, but only approximately 1-2% of this area represents its highly localised and specialised riverine habitat; the effective range of the species may therefore be in the order of 1 100-2 200 km2.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be widespread and locally common (del Hoyo et al. 2001). It is generally uncommon even in prime habitat with breeding pairs spaced at least 1 km apart (Clancey 1996). Because the species is widely perceived as rare and elusive (with a SABAP1 mean reporting rate for range of only 4.1%, compared to e.g. 15.8% for Malachite Kingfisher A. cristata), actual declines in population and range can easily be overlooked. Because of its specialised habitat requirements only a small proportion of its range constitutes suitable habitat, and territories are widely spaced even in seemingly ideal conditions. Given a range of 1 100-2 200 km2, and assuming linear riverine territories encompassing 1 km of river (plus buffer zones of riparian vegetation extending to 50 m on either bank), a crude calculation suggests the population may be in the order of 11 000-22 000 pairs. However, actual numbers are probably much lower, e.g. only seven were counted along 61.5 km of the Komati River in Swaziland, i.e. 1 bird/8.8 km of river frontage (Allan 2000d). The regional population may thus number less than10 000 mature individuals. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Globally, the Half-collared Kingfisher has declined owing to pollution, river siltation and habitat destruction (BirdLife International 2014ci). The regional population is also suspected to be experiencing a decline, as revealed by bird atlas data (although this decline is suspected to not attain the 30% threshold). Relative abundance data presented by Clancey and Herremans (1997) sparked concerns about a marked decrease, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal where coastal populations appear to have declined drastically compared with areas to the immediate south in Eastern Cape (Clancey 1992, Allan 2000d). This decline may have become more widespread and severe, as a comparison between SABAP1 and SABAP2 data suggests a decrease of 13.3% in EoO, and 40.6% in AoO, and comparative maps show notable increases in range fragmentation over much of the region. Confidence in the population trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A strictly water-associated kingfisher, restricted to the immediate vicinity of fast-flowing, clear, perennial streams and rivers offering secluded conditions and dense marginal vegetation (Turpie 2005c). It also frequents well-vegetated banks of lakes, dams, estuaries and coastal lagoons (Fry et al. 1988), and occasionally fishes in salt water in Eastern Cape Province (Maclean 1993). It occurs from sea-level to 2 000 masl and is most frequent in broken escarpment terrain (Clancey and Herremans 1997). It is timid and inconspicuous, remains motionless for long periods, and is easily overlooked. It is usually encountered singly or in pairs. Despite its reported shyness it also occurs along small dams and wooded streams and canals in urban and suburban areas. For construction of the nest tunnel, it requires vertical riverbanks, usually 1.0-1.5 m (0.3-4.5 m) high, facing the water, and with overhanging vegetation or tree roots to provide concealment. Tunnels may be used for successive broods and in successive years. Egg-laying occurs main in September to October, and occasionally in other months (Tarboton 2011). A generation of 4.4 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014ci). It is largely sedentary, but probably undergoes local movements off the central plateau with the decline of river run-off in the dry winter months (Clancey and Herremans 1997). The diet consists primarily of fish 30-70 mm in length, as well as crabs, amphibians and aquatic insects (Fry et al. 1988).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Half-collared Kingfisher is one of 11 South African waterbird species primarily restricted to riverine habitats; the beleaguered position of river ecosystems in South Africa is highlighted by the fact that seven of these species are considered threatened or near-threatened (Allan et al. 1997a). The Half-collared Kingfisher is threatened by widespread degradation of its specialised riverine habitats, through siltation, erosion, inflow of water containing suspended sediments, heavy metals and other pollutants, water extraction and clearing of riparian vegetation (Allan 2000d). Due to the linear connectivity of its habitat, consequences of detrimental factors are not limited to the point of impact but also occur downstream. Likewise, dams and other impoundments may have major ecological impacts downstream, through reduced river flow, attenuated flood peaks, and altering seasonality and temperature of flow, sediment loads, channel morphology and water chemistry (Barnes 2000a). Species adapted to fast-flowing, clear and relatively nutrient-poor ecosystems, such as the Half-collared Kingfisher, are particularly vulnerable to algal blooms caused by eutrophication by run-off from agricultural and mining activities, sewage works and other sources. Changes in river catchments, including alien plant invasion, irrigation, over-abstraction, human settlement and overgrazing have reduced natural run-off and groundwater levels substantially (Barnes 2000a). Availability of suitable banks for construction of nest tunnels may be a further limiting factor for this species. It is unknown whether infestation of waterways by alien fish constitutes a threat.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures are currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Given its specialised habitat requirements, the Half-collared Kingfisher is of great value as an indicator species for the quality of river ecosystems throughout its range, particularly in a region with an overall scarcity and ever-increasing demand for water. A full census of representative river systems should be conducted, which could simultaneously contribute to population estimates of co-occurring threatened species such as White-backed Night-Heron Gorsachius leuconotus and African Finfoot Podica senegalensis. Whittington-Jones (2011) proposed a target of 240 pairs for Gauteng rivers, and indicated that considerable restoration work will be required given the poor state of rivers in the province. While local conservation efforts are commendable, the long-term conservation of the Half-collard Kingfisher, and a host of other aquatic and riverine species, will ultimately depend on effective management, conservation and restoration of rivers at the ecosystem-level through national, provincial and municipal initiatives.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Karoo Korhaan Eupodotis vigorsii is suspected to have undergone a population decline approaching 30% over the last 10 years. The cause of this reduction is not perfectly understood. The species is assessed as regional Near Threatened pending further population trend data.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The majority of the Karoo Korhaan's global range is in South Africa. Preliminary data suggest the species underwent a decline of greater than 50% in AoO between the two atlas projects. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Previously considered conspecific with the Rüppell's Korhaan E. rueppellii (Clancey 1980); the two taxa are allospecies and intermediate specimens may indicate occasional hybridisation (Clancey et al. 1991). </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">56-60 cm, 1.4-1.6 kg. Sexes differ slightly in plumage colouration. Head and neck plain grey-brown, upperparts and wing coverts grey-brown and finely vermiculated darker brown. Remiges black with cream-coloured bases, forming pale panel on outer wing in flight. Paler moustachial stripe bordered by black throat patch extending as narrow black streak down foreneck (absent in female). Black patch on nape. Bill dark horn, paler at base. Eyes greyish brown. Legs dull yellow (Clancey 1967, Allan 2005i). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Endemic to the xerophytic dwarf shrublands of the Karoo Biome in western South Africa and southern Namibia (Hockey and Boobyer 1994, Allan 1997g). Within the region, occurs from the western Free State and near the Great Fish River Estuary in Eastern Cape (Tree 1973), westwards across the arid interior of Western Cape and Northern Cape provinces and north to the Orange River. Since at least the 1860s, has extended into agricultural areas on the Agulhas Plain, Western Cape, where it occurs in bare fallow wheat lands and planted pastures but is scarce or absent in adjacent remnant patches of Renosterveld (Uys 1981, Allan 1997g). Extends into the Karoo-Grassland biome ecotone in the east of its range, but replaced in higher rainfall grasslands by the Blue Korhaan E. caerulescens (Hockey and Boobyer 1994). The limits of its distribution in southern Namibia are unclear as it was previously considered conspecific with Rüppell's Korhaan (Allan 1997g). SABAP2 data suggests an AoO of c. 166 000 km2. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size is unknown, but Siegfried (1992) estimated the South African population to be ‘hundreds of thousands'. Population densities have been measured at 1 group/0.5-3.3 km2, with territories being the largest in more arid areas. Likewise, average group size is higher in drier areas: average 2.24 birds in the arid Succulent Karoo, 2.19 in Nama Karoo, and 2.09 on Agulhas Plain (Allan 2005i); larger groups may be beneficial in terms of territorial defence, foraging efficiency or vigilance against predators (Hockey and Boobyer 1994). Mostly encountered in pairs (72%), but male and female are regularly accompanied by 1 (16%) or 2 (3%) additional birds, mostly male offspring; rarely seen alone or in groups of 5-6 birds (Hockey and Boobyer 1994). Based on data of Hockey and Boobyer (1994) and Allan (2005i), a coarse extrapolation of average group size and average group territory size divided by the regional AoO, suggests that the total South African population may lie in the order of c. 250 000 birds. Confidence in this estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 data suggests the Karoo Korhaan has undergone an alarming c. 50% decrease in AoO, which is of particular concern as the majority of its global range falls within South Africa. However, the reasons for this apparent contraction are unclear and warrant investigation. The species was not considered threatened by Brooke (1984) or Barnes (2000a). Anecdotal historical accounts suggest that the species may have increased in abundance, possibly as a result of its ability to exploit habitats modified by pastoralism over the past 150 years (Boobyer and Hockey 1994). Its colonisation of cereal croplands in the Overberg region also suggests a degree of adaptability to disturbed habitats. Nevertheless, a bustard conservation workshop in 2009 identified the Karoo Korhaan as subject to a high perceived level of threat. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Karoo Korhaan frequents stony ground in flat or undulating landscapes, with vegetation 10-40 cm tall and 30-60% plant cover, preferring areas with a wide variety of perennial shrubs and annuals but relatively little grass cover (Allan 2005i). The species is sedentary and territorial, despite the unpredictable and generally low rainfall within its range (20-520 mm per year); this is reflected in its dietary opportunism and a diverse prey spectrum (Boobyer and Hockey 1994). Diet dominated by plant material (80% by mass) of a wide variety of species, but particularly those favouring disturbed conditions such as arise after heavy grazing by livestock (Boobyer and Hockey 1994). The species may be an important dispersal agent for endozoochorous plant seeds and may play a role in rehabilitation of disturbed areas (Boobyer and Hockey 1994). Lays a single egg between June and February (peaking October-November; Tarboton 2011). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Power-lines, climate change, and impact of poisons used during locust-control operations are general threats faced by the Karoo Korhaan (Allan and Anderson 2010). Farming activities pose a local threat to eggs and small chicks in agricultural areas, such as on the Agulhas Plain (Uys 1981). Crows are recorded as frequent nest predators (Uys 1981), and increasing abundance of crows may have a local impact on breeding success in some areas. The species is preyed upon by large eagles, and is the most common prey item of Martial Eagles in the Karoo (Boshoff et al. 1990). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation efforts are underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">While the Karoo Korhaan remains relatively common and widespread, atlas data suggest that an overlooked decrease in range and population might be occurring. The causes for this apparent decline are not fully understood and should be assessed so that appropriate conservation measures can be implemented if necessary. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population may approach the threshold for Vulnerable under the population-size criterion (less than10 000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be greater than 10% in ten years or three generations). Although it is not of immediate conservation concern, the Agulhas Long-billed Lark has a naturally small range and population that make it vulnerable to natural or anthropogenic changes to its habitat. Widespread conversion of scrub habitat into agriculture fields and pasture has more than likely benefited this species, but future changes in land-use may prove detrimental. For these reasons, the species was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is endemic to the region. In addition, it was assessed as Near Threatened in the 2000 assessment. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Agulhas Long-billed Lark has only recently been recognised as a full species, previously being considered a subspecies of the ‘Long-billed Lark C. curvirostris', which was initially described as four species (Roberts 1940), but subsequently lumped as a single, wide-ranging polytypic species. However, modern evidence suggests that the taxon is best viewed as five distinct species (Ryan and Bloomer 1999). Within the long-billed lark complex, the Agulhas Long-billed Lark C. brevirostris forms part of a group comprising coastal and grassland taxa including the Cape Long-billed Lark C. curvirostris and the Eastern Long-billed Lark C. semitorquata, which differ by at least 2% in sequence divergence of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene. Within this group, C. brevirostris is most closely related to C. curvirostris, but their ranges are separated by the Cape Fold Mountains, which form a natural barrier between these species. In addition to a genetic difference, they differ morphometrically, in plumage and vocalisations (Ryan and Bloomer 1999). However, some ambiguity exists regarding the taxonomy of the long-billed lark complex, with some authorities arguing that C. brevirostris and the Benguela Long-billed Lark C. benguelensis should not be elevated to species-level. In the latter case, brevirostris should be lumped with curvirostris, a species currently considered globally and regionally of Least Concern. Nevertheless, a prudent approach warrants viewing Agulhas Long-billed Lark as a full species, and therefore a conservation priority.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">18-21 cm, c. 45 g. A range-restricted, but locally common and fairly conspicuous and bulky lark. In the field appears large but slim, with long wings and a heavy tail. Sexes alike in plumage colouration, but males larger. Adults buffy brown to grey-brown above, with dark brown streaking, heavier on crown and mantle than on rump and uppertail coverts. Below creamy buff, extensively streaked dark brown on breast, flanks and often undertail coverts; markings heavier and blotchier on breast, but thinner and more linear on flanks. Throat whitish and lightly spotted. Tail dark brown; central rectrices with broad buff-brown edges, remainder with narrow buffy outer edges. Face with fairly broad buff supercillium, but indistinct dark brown eye-stripe; pale throat extends in a C-shape around rear of ear coverts. Bill blackish horn, with a slightly paler base; fairly short to long and decurved. Eyes brown. Legs and feet pinkish brown. Juveniles have buffy tips to feathers of crown, mantle and wing coverts, imparting a spotted appearance; breast more diffusely spotted rather than streaked (Keith et al. 1992, Ryan and Dean 2005a, Peacock 2012).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As its name implies, the Agulhas Long-billed Lark is endemic to South Africa's Western Cape Province and largely restricted to the Agulhas Plain and Overberg wheatbelt, east of the Hottentots Holland Mountains. The species is mostly limited to a c. 15 000 km2 area between the Bot River and Caledon (approximately 19°E) and Mossel Bay (22°E), and mostly south of 34°S (Ryan and Bloomer 1999). It reportedly occurs northward along the Breede River Valley to at least Worcester, and possibly as far north-west as Tulbagh (Dean 1997c), but this has not been confirmed by most recent bird atlas data. While the species can be common in its small range, its distribution is patchy and fragmented for unknown reasons (Barnes 2000q).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Agulhas Long-billed Lark is fairly common within its fragmented, patchily distributed habitat (Ryan and Dean 2005a). The total population has not been accurately quantified. Crude preliminary findings suggest that, in optimal habitats, local densities range from c. 0.075-0.2 calling males/ha, while overall densities range from c. 0.02-0.11 calling males/ha in good habitat to c. 0.003-0.009 in poor habitat (Louw 2000). Not correcting for sampling bias and variations in detectability, assuming a sex ratio of 1:1, and regarding only 25% of the above mentioned area as suitable habitat, a rough total population estimate is between 1 600-60 000 adults. The true population is possibly c. 9 000 individuals. Confidence in this population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This taxon was only recently recognised as a full species and, as such, demographic trends are not yet well documented.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Approximately 60-70% of the range of Agulhas Long-billed Lark has been transformed into wheat fields and pasture land (Louw 2000, Barnes 2000q) although the species may have benefited from conversion of its natural habitat (Dean 1997c). Indeed, densities inside protected areas are significantly lower than densities in farmlands surrounding reserves. Low overall plant cover is reportedly the most important habitat selection factor, and open habitats with scattered bush cover and low, structurally diverse, species-rich vegetation are favoured. This lark shows a preference for lucerne fields and young fallow fields (density greater than 0.15 calling males/ha). Such habitats remain constant in extent year-round, and birds congregate in pastures if displaced from bare or sparsely vegetated fields when crops become too tall and dense after winter rains. However, field surveys suggest that the birds are mostly sedentary throughout the year, despite habitat changes due to sowing of cereal crops. Bare or recently ploughed fields and burnt areas are also readily utilised. They also occur in sparse Renosterbos Dicerothamnus rhinocerotis shrubland, as well as dwarf Karoo Shrubland on clay soils in the foothills of the Breede River Valley. They are less common in Coastal Fynbos and Sand Plains Fynbos, favouring sandy areas (Louw 2000, Ryan and Dean 2005a). Territorial males hold non-overlapping territories centred on elevated calling posts such as fences, ridges and bushy areas (Louw 2000). The species is primarily insectivorous.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Vegetation management practices in formal conservation areas, such as De Hoop Nature Reserve and Bontebok National Park, are not beneficial to the Agulhas Long-billed Lark, and it is poorly represented in protected areas (Louw 2000). It is unclear to what extent this species has been influenced by the large-scale conversion of its natural habitat, but it has been suggested that certain forms of agriculture are beneficial to it (Dean 1997c). Nevertheless, its naturally limited range and small population, as well as its dependence on transformed and privately-owned land, makes ongoing monitoring essential (Louw 2000). The potential effects of climate change on this species have not been fully investigated. The farming practices on which this species depends are unlikely to change over a broad geographical area in the near future, but economic pressures are causing farmers to abandon agriculture in drier areas. This may lead to local extinctions or further range fragmentation in the Agulhas Long-billed Lark (Louw 2000).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation actions are currently underway. Basic research into the habitat requirements and ecology of this species has been conducted (Louw 2000).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The long-term survival of the Agulhas Long-billed Lark rests in the hands of private land-owners. Education and, where possible, guidance on land-use practices that are beneficial to this species are recommended. Concurrently, attempts should be made to improve the status of this species within conserved areas. To this end, a burning regime aimed at preventing bush encroachment is recommended, and a system of occasional autumn fires with three years of follow-up burns will benefit the Agulhas Long-billed Lark, while simultaneously improving grazing conditions for larger species of game (Louw 2000). Monitoring in the form of bird atlasing and species-specific surveys should be conducted to elucidate demographic trends. Finally, a thorough investigation of the taxonomic status of this taxon within the long-billed lark complex is essential, as it may have important implications for biodiversity conservation (Ryan and Bloomer 1999).</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Barlow's Lark Calendulauda barlowi has a restricted range, and an AoO less than2 000 km2, which would qualify it as Vulnerable under the range-size criterion. However, the species is not limited to a small number of locations and is not believed to be subject to severe range fragmentation or extreme fluctuations in range or population. Although the population is apparently decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to meet the threshold for Vulnerable (greater than 30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified, but may qualify the species as regionally Vulnerable under the population-size criterion (less than10 000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be greater than 10% in ten years or three generations). However, further research is required before such conclusions can be drawn. For these reasons Barlow's Lark is provisionally evaluated as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Barlow's Lark is a recently recognised species, endemic to north-western South Africa and adjacent southern Namibia. It was considered synonymous with Karoo Lark C. albescens during SABAP1, and its distribution was therefore not specifically documented. Although this species occurs in inhospitable regions with low human densities, its range and population within the region are small (Ryan et al. 1998). Concerns have been raised about is conservation, and although the species is considered globally of Least Concern, it was classified as regionally Near Threatened by Barnes (2000s).</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A recently recognised cryptic species that was previously considered conspecific with the widespread Karoo Lark C. albescens, but was elevated to full species status following analyses of genetic, morphological and vocal data of subspecies in the Karoo Lark complex (Ryan et al. 1998). It is similar to the Karoo Lark in plumage, vocalisations and ecology, and apparently hybridises with it in a narrow contact zone between Port Nolloth and the Orange River at Sendelingsdrift and the Richtersveld Plains in Northern Cape Province.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">17-19 cm. 28-31 g. Sexes alike, but bill c. 14% longer in male. In the field appears fairly large with a thick neck, big head and strong, robust bill; bill is longer in birds living on soft sands. Upperparts grey, sandy brown, pinkish or orange-brown (depending on soil colour), with variably intense streaking on crown and mantle. Rump almost plain. Face strongly patterned, with white supercilium and crescent below eye, black eye-stripe, and black malar and moustachial stripes. Underparts white, breast and upper belly with blackish, blotchy streaks, not extending to flanks. Tail dark brown; central pair of rectrices with broad rufous-brown outer margins and dark central streak on average 51% of feather width; outer rectrices narrowly edged cream. Flight feathers dark brown with rufous or grey-brown edges. Tertials with distinct dark central wedges. Bill blackish horn with paler base. Eyes brown. Legs and feet grey-brown. Three subspecies are currently defined, but even within subspecies' boundaries, individuals vary in colour to match soil colour. Juveniles similar to adults but have more diffuse, rounded, rufous or brown breast spots and buff tips and dark sub-terminal bands on feathers of crown, nape, mantle and uppertail coverts imparting a spotted, scaly or barred appearance (Keith et al. 1992, Ryan and Dean 2005b, Peacock 2012).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Barlow's Lark is endemic to the coastal plain of Namaqualand in north-eastern Northern Cape, South Africa, and adjacent south-western Namibia. Its range extends from Port Nolloth and Sendelingsdrift in Northern Cape to about 10-15 km south of the Koichab River, east of Lüderitz in Namibia. It has a maximum EoO of 18 000 km2, making it one of the most restricted southern African endemics (Ryan et al. 1998). Although locally common, it is marginal in South Africa and the regional population is small (Barnes 2000r). More than 80% of its global range falls within Namibia, particularly in that country's inaccessible Sperrgebiet diamond-mining region (Dean and Ryan 1997a, Ryan et al. 1998).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014cj). The species is described as locally common in suitable habitat (Barnes 2000r). It appears to now be absent from commercial farms around Aus in Namibia, where it was first collected (Ryan et al. 1998). However, detailed quantitative and demographic data are unavailable.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population trend is suspected to be in decline (BirdLife International 2014cj), possibly as a result of grazing pressure which leads to a lack of suitable vegetation. Populations in restricted-access diamond-mining zones may be relatively stable, and population declines are not currently believed to be sufficiently rapid to qualify Barlow's Lark as regionally Vulnerable. Confidence in this population trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Barlow's Lark is found in the dry transitional zone between the Succulent Karoo and the Namib Desert, a region that experiences low rainfall, primarily in winter (Engelbrecht and Lonzer 2009). The species occurs in a relatively broad range of habitats, but in particular Euphorbia gummifera hummock vegetation on sandy soils. It also breeds in coastal dune vegetation, sparse Succulent Karoo scrub and vegetated dunes (Dean and Ryan 1997a, Engelbrecht and Lonzer 2009), but is absent from open plains devoid of vegetation (Ryan and Dean 2005b).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Barlow's Lark, and other species in the Karoo Lark complex, are restricted to natural habitats and are generally absent from transformed areas, being sensitive to overgrazing (Dean and Ryan 1997a). The related Red Lark C. burra has disappeared from some areas because of grazing and trampling by livestock, and associated changes in vegetation structure and composition (Dean et al. 1991). Fortunately, almost all of the Barlow's Lark's range falls within diamond-mining areas, where domestic livestock are excluded. However, if diamond mining becomes less profitable, alternative land-uses may be implemented in such areas in future (Dean and Ryan 1997a). The effects of climate change on this species have not been fully investigated; however, its restricted range and westerly, coast-bound distribution potentially put it at risk (Simmons et al. 2004). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation efforts are underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Barlow's Lark is an excellent candidate as an indicator species to monitor the effects of climate change, and a flagship species for conservation of a range of other threatened endemic taxa (Ryan et al. 1998). The long-term protection of the species is relatively secure, especially in view of the declaration of the Sperrgebiet in southern Namibia as a national park in 2004 (Dean and Ryan 1997a). Within South Africa, the Orange River Mouth Wetlands IBA (SA030) and Ramsar site may support small numbers of this species. However, a large proportion of its regional range falls within diamond-mining zones, where restricted access, low human population and exclusion of livestock have ensured relatively pristine vegetation (Barnes 2000r). Monitoring of population trends, and concurrent distribution mapping, should be priorities. Research on habitat requirements and land-management practices advantageous to this species should be conducted.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Sclater's Lark Spizocorys sclateri is a sparse, under-recorded semi-desert specialist, restricted to western South Africa and southern Namibia. Previous authors pointed out that there was no evidence that this species had undergone a range contraction, but pending more conclusive atlas coverage, new atlas data suggest that Sclater's Lark warrants monitoring.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of this species' global range occurs in the region. In addition, it was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000 and is currently listed as globally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Three subspecies have been described: the nominate S. s. sclateri, S. s. capensis and S. s. theresae, but these are poorly differentiated and the species is generally considered monotypic (Keith et al. 1992, Lloyd 2005c).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">13-14 cm. Sexes alike. A small, stocky, finch-like lark with a robust bill that appears recurved. Crown and mantle brownish with darker streaking. Face pattern well developed, with a prominent supercilium contrasting with a dark eye stripe, and a pale crescent below the eye bordered below by a dark crescent and dark vertical band; ear coverts brown with a paler patch towards base of bill; dark malar stripes usually striking. Chin and throat whitish. Breast and flanks rich, dark orange to buff, with bold breast streaks and sometimes diffuse flank streaks. Tail dark brown with white panels on outer webs of outer 2-3 rectrices, forming a conspicuous chat-like pattern. Remiges dark brown with pale buff edges. Bill long and heavy with brownish pink base and darker culmen and tip. Eyes brown. Legs and feet pale brown. Juvenile similar, but with less distinct face pattern, more diffuse breast spots and spotted pattern above due to whitish feather tips (Keith et al. 1992, Lloyd 2005c, Peacock 2012).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Sclater's Lark is endemic to the barren, open landscapes of western South Africa and southern Namibia. The centre of distribution lies in Northern Cape's Nama Karoo Biome, where this species occurs in a highly fragmented fashion across a vast area. An apparently isolated outlying population is found in Western Cape near Beaufort West (Dean 1997d). The species is most abundant on the stony plains of Bushmanland, between Brandvlei and Pofadder, but even there is reported as scarce and local (Dean 1997d). Its movements are poorly understood, and, depending on localised rainfall events, it may be a nomadic opportunist at the fringes of its range. However, in the core of its range, it is considered sedentary or at most locally nomadic, and may breed in the exact same locality in consecutive years, irrespective of rainfall (Lloyd 1999). Indeed, Lloyd (1999) recorded the highest breeding densities in drought years. Vagrants occasionally occur outside the normal range, suggesting sporadic long-distance dispersal (Clarke 1981). The species is uncommon and highly localised in southern Namibia; however, incomplete sampling likely contributes to its apparent rarity there, and recent sight records suggest that it is more widespread in Namibia (Barnes 2000s).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Based on SABAP1 data, Barnes (2000s) estimated that the AoO may be 68 600 km2, of which c. 63 000 km2 is located in Bushmanland in Northern Cape. The estimated regional AoO was calculated at c. 47 500 km2 in the previous assessment (Barnes 2000s), but the latest atlas data suggest that the species may now have a regional AoO of only c. 8 000 km2, representing a decrease of 83%. However, virtually the entire range falls within arid and sparsely populated parts of Northern Cape and consequently the species has almost certainly been widely overlooked. If the species is in decline, the rate of decline is believed to be less severe than suggested by atlas data. Sclater's Lark has been recorded in a single IBA, namely Mattheus-Gat Conservation Area (SA034).</p>
	<h2>POPULATION JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Neither the regional or global population has been quantified but the species is considered uncommon and localised (BirdLife International 2014ck). It would be very challenging to provide an accurate population estimate given the bird's small size and unobtrusive nature, and the remoteness of its barren habitat. Lloyd (1999) reported a density of 0.72-1.75 nests per 100 km in a linear transect.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 data indicates a decrease in EoO and AoO, which may imply a decline in the regional population. However, due to the lack of coverage throughout the species' range, it is unwise to draw conclusions from this analysis and no population trend justification is proposed here.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Sclater's Lark occurs on arid to semi-arid gravelly and stony plains with scattered shrubs and grass tufts on shale soils, and sparse dwarf shrublands on clays. It is often found in areas with impeded drainage and extensive bare patches of quartz gravel, virtually devoid of vegetation (Keith et al. 1992, Dean 1997d, Lloyd 2005c). Sclater's Lark is one of the very few bird species that thrives in its specific habitat. Its breeding biology is optimised to survival in arid conditions; for example, it invariably lays a single egg, which is nearly constantly shaded against the sun (Lloyd 1999). Sclater's Lark is primarily granivorous, its large bill enabling it to obtain large seeds hidden in the basal leaf sheaths of dead grasses; a valuable resource generally not available to other granivores (Lloyd 2005c). Insects such as termites, caterpillars, grasshoppers, ants and small beetles are also eaten (Lloyd 2005c). It drinks frequently (including from artificial stock watering points), and nests are typically constructed less than1 km from a water source (Lloyd 2005c).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Sclater's Lark is a naturally sparsely distributed and localised specialist of arid environments with low reproductive output, and is seldom common, even in apparently optimal habitat (Dean 1997d). However, it is also easily overlooked and is likely more widespread and numerous than current records suggest. Neither breeding nor clutch size seem to be closely related to rainfall (Lloyd 1999), but the potential effects of climate change on Sclater's Lark have need to be properly investigated, and may be severe considering that the species appears to be less nomadic and mobile than other small granivorous passerines (Barnes 2000s). Although the species is poorly represented in formally protected areas, it persists on privately owned farms, and has likely benefited from stock watering points (Lloyd 2005c). Nevertheless, its range is small and fragmented, and appears to be contracting. It may also be prone to extreme fluctuations in EoO and numbers of mature individuals.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures are currently underway, and the species is poorly represented in protected areas. Because it is under-reported, population declines may go unnoticed.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Before an effective management plan can be compiled for this species, more data on its population size and distribution are required. An investigation into the threats faced by Sclater's Lark, and the potential mitigation measures to counteract such threats, should follow. Practically, responsibility for the species' long-term conservation will lie with private land-owners and appropriate management of their properties. Education of land-owners and compilation of management guidelines provided by conservation institutions will be beneficial in this regard.</p>

Although the exact rate of decline is unknown, it is thought to approach but not exceed the 30% threshold required to qualify this species as regionally Vulnerable.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global range of the Short-clawed Lark occurs within the region. In addition, the species was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000. </p>

Crown has dark, bold streaking and broad buffish brown to rufous margins. Hindneck with pale collar. Dorsal feathers and wing coverts rusty-brown with darker centres. A diagnostic feature is the broad rufous rump on which faint darker streaking can only be seen at close range. Tail light brown, central rectrices with broad tawny to rufous outer margins. Outer rectrices with buff margins. Flight feathers dusky with buff outer edges on outer primaries, becoming more tawny and rufous towards secondaries. Tertials with broad tawny to rufous-brown edges. Upper breast shows dark streaks. Fairly long, slightly decurved bill dark grey-brown with pale base. Eyes dark brown. Legs dark flesh to pale brown. Juvenile slightly more rufous and appears mottled (Herremans 2005a).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Short-clawed Lark is endemic to Botswana and South Africa. Within its range it has a disjunct distribution, divided between two geographical areas, a western population in south-eastern Botswana and adjacent South Africa and a smaller eastern population in South Africa's Limpopo Province. Both populations are found at an altitudinal range of 1 000-1 400 m. The western population's stronghold is the rural areas of south-eastern Botswana (Herremans 1993). In South Africa, the western population has the highest reporting rate in a triangle created by Dinokana in the north-east, Madibogo in the south and Tshidilamolomo in the north-west of North West Province. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Although the western population appears to have experienced a range contraction towards the north, it is probably not significant as the areas where the species has not been recorded in SABAP2 represent marginal habitat and SABAP1 records from the Free State are considered dubious (Engelbrecht et al. 2007). Outside the above mentioned triangle, there are scattered records from the semi-arid thornveld and arid grassland habitats in North West and Northern Cape provinces. The eastern population is largely confined to the Polokwane Plateau Bushveld and Makhado Sweet Bushveld vegetation types (Engelbrecht 2005). The EoO for the eastern population is less than5 000 km2, while that of the western population is less than20 000 km2 for the western population. The AoO is unknown, but given the very specific ecological requirements of the species, is certainly only a small fraction of the combined c. 25 000 km2 EoO.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There is no information currently available regarding the global population. Siegfried et al. (1976a) crudely estimated the global population to number in the tens of thousands while Herremans (1993) estimated there to be over 10 000 pairs in Botswana alone. Siegfried et al. (1976a) estimated that in South Africa as few as 100-300 birds occur within protected areas. Brooke (1984) suggested that the western population of the species comprises approximately 500-5 000 birds. According to Engelbrecht (2005) the Polokwane Nature Reserve represents the stronghold for the eastern population, containing between 80-150 mature individuals (Barnes and Tarboton 1998). More recently, Grosel (2007) estimated the eastern population of Short-clawed Lark to be small, with an estimated effective population size of 760 mature individuals of which at least 120 mature individuals occur in the formally protected Polokwane Nature Reserve. The regional population is thought to be less than5 000 mature individuals. The confidence in this regional population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is unknown. Engelbrecht et al. (2007) reported a 73% reduction in EoO in the western population's range and a 28% decline in population size for the total western sub-population (Grosel 2007). According to Grosel (2007), it is thought that declines in both populations was below the 30% threshold which would qualify the species as regionally Vulnerable. Confidence in the regional population trend estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Found in semi-arid Vachellia (Acacia) savannah, sparsely vegetated with short grass and scattered low bushes (Herremans and Herremans 1992). In Botswana the species is mainly recorded on granitic soils on fallow land, heavily grazed by livestock, where there are scattered, coppicing bushes in traditional subsistence farming areas (Herremans and Herremans 1992). Brooke (1984) described the habitat of this lark as semi-arid Camphor Bush Tarchonanthus camphoratus savannah, but Engelbrecht et al. (2007) questioned this description, and such vegetation types are likely to be marginal habitat for the species. A generation length of 3.5 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014cl).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Grosel (2007) summarised the threats to the eastern population of the Short-clawed Lark which include habitat loss or change due to urban expansion, agriculture, bush encroachment, lack of fire and an inadequate number of formally protected areas. Their close association with habitats around rural areas pose other threats which cannot be quantified at present, e.g. the effect of predation by free-roaming cats and dogs on breeding success, hunting for food by humans and through further habitat change as a result of bush encroachment or complete denudation of the grass layer through overgrazing and trampling. In South Africa, both populations have high reporting rates in rural and traditional agricultural areas. Although it generally avoids commercial farming areas, the species may be affected indirectly by the use of pesticides, which may reduce its prey base. Most significantly, Grosel (2007) revealed that the Short-clawed Lark has very low levels of genetic variation that may render the species vulnerable to the effects of inbreeding or stochastic environmental events.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Short-clawed Lark has been a species of conservation concern since the first regional Red Data books were published in the 1970s (Grosel 2007). In these publications, its status ranged from ‘rare' (Siegfried et al. 1976a) to ‘indeterminate' (Brooke 1984), and to Near Threatened (Barnes 2000a). Its inclusion in Red Data lists is principally due to its highly localised distribution within its relatively small global range (Grosel 2007). The Short-clawed Lark's preferred habitat is susceptible to rapid detrimental change with incorrect management practices. Recommendations with regard to habitat management in the Polokwane Nature Reserve have been drawn up and submitted to the relevant authority. The species is listed as specially protected wild animal under the Limpopo Environmental Management Act 7 of 2003.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Environmental management legislation should be enforced (Grosel 2007). Education and awareness programmes, aimed at educating commercial game and stock farmers on the Short-clawed Lark's habitat requirements, should be implemented (Grosel 2007). The species requires careful monitoring as Grosel (2007) showed that their numbers can decrease dramatically within a short period due to habitat changes. Responsible veld management in combination with grazing by livestock or game will ensure a healthy environment which will in turn provide suitable habitat for various grassland bird species and other taxa of the Polokwane Plateau, with the Short-clawed Lark as a flagship.</p>

	<h3>Research priorities and questions</h3>
	<p class="boxies" lang="en-US">Research on the species' distribution range and relative abundance within its AoO is necessary to establish a framework for monitoring to obtain a better understanding of its current status. In addition, a survey of parts of the distribution of the western population in south-eastern Botswana is required in order to establish whether a similar decline has occurred.

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Rosy-throated Longclaw Macronyx ameliae has experienced a marked range contraction since the collection of the species' type specimen in Durban in 1845. It has also undergone a decline in the extent and quality of its sensitive wetland habitat in northern KwaZulu-Natal, which is suspected to have resulted in a concomitant decline in the regional population. It is thought that this population decline approaches, but does meet, the 30% threshold over a three generation period to qualify the species as regionally Vulnerable. Consequently it is listed as regionally Near Threatened. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Rosy-throated Longclaw was listed as Near Threatened in the 2000 regional assessment.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Three subspecies have been described, but these are not widely recognised (e.g. lumped under nominate by Keith et al. 1992; omitted by Gill and Donsker 2015). The nominate M. a. ameliae occurs in KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">19-20 cm, 33 g. An attractive longclaw of wetland edges. Sexes differ in size (male slightly larger) and plumage (female paler and less vividly pink). Most notable field mark is bright pinkish scarlet throat framed by black band. Pink wash extends onto lower breast and belly. Sides of breast to flanks pale buff to whitish and finely streaked. Upperparts and wing coverts dark olive-brown to blackish, feathers broadly edged buff. Marginal wing coverts edged pink to orange. Supercilium whitish to buff, contrasting with cinnamon-brown ear coverts. Tail dark brown; outer rectrices white, and adjacent pair broadly tipped white. Bill blackish, base of lower mandible pale yellow. Eyes brown. Legs and feet pale brown (Chittenden 2005e). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The nominate M. a. ameliae is now restricted to a small, isolated population occurring along the northern coastal littoral zone of KwaZulu-Natal (Peacock 2006), from the Kosi Bay area on the Mozambique border, south to St Lucia (Chittenden 2005e). It also extends northwards into Mozambique, to the approximate vicinity of Xai-Xai. Parker (1999) mentions that the species is rare in southern Mozambique, but it may be overlooked in that poorly explored country. An allopatric population (‘M. a. altanus') occurs on the central plateau of Zimbabwe, in the Okavango Delta area of Botswana and further north in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zambia (Peacock 2006). Longclaws are not prone to vagrancy due to their rather short, rounded wings and overall weak flight (Peacock 2006) and it is unlikely that the species occurs outside of the areas mentioned above. Within the region the Rosy-throated Longclaw has been recorded in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park IBA. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population remains unquantified (BirdLife International 2014cm). There is little information currently available on the population status of Rosy-throated Longclaw in the region. Johnson et al. (1998) estimated there to be between 400-500 mature individuals in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park IBA (SA058). The Kosi Bay System IBA (SA053) was estimated to hold 20-40 mature individuals whilst the Lake Sibaya IBA (SA054) supports an estimated 40-100 mature individuals. These figures suggest a total number of 460-640 mature individuals in the IBA network in the region, calculated in 1998. It is believed that the number of individuals within protected areas has increased with the establishment of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. The number of mature individuals outside of the protected network is unknown. The regional population is estimated to be c. 1 500 mature individuals, but view of increasing deterioration of wetland habitats outside of protected areas, a more conservative regional population estimate of 520-670 mature individuals is proposed. However, confidence in this population estimate is low and it requires verification.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population trend is suspected to be in decline owing to ongoing habitat destruction. The majority of the population falls within the protected iSimangaliso Wetland Park, which now includes all three IBA's mentioned above, and is not thought to have declined significantly. Birds occurring outside of the protected area to the west of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, have been impacted upon by increasing human pressure. This corresponds with decreases shown in the comparison of SABAP1 with SABAP2 data. It is assumed that the regional population has declined accordingly. The confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Rosy-throated Longclaw usually occurs in pairs or family groups. The species is highly specific to subtropical pan margins and floodplain habitats (Peacock 2006) and prefers short, damp or waterlogged grass along the edges of lakes and vleis (Chittenden 2005e). The species is primarily insectivorous, but will also eat small frogs (Chittenden 2005e). Mostly resident, but some nomadic short-distance dispersal occurs as necessitated by flood-levels.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Habitat fragmentation, degradation and destruction are the main threats to this species. This includes overgrazing, wetland drainage, conversion for agriculture (including afforestation and sugarcane), unfavourable burning practices and interference with flood&#173;plain ecology through upriver impoundment and water extraction (Chittenden 2005e). Parker (1999) makes mention that the disturbance of wetlands is threatening sub-populations in neighbouring Sul do Save in southern Mozambique.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are currently no conservation measures focusing on the Rosy-throated Longclaw in place. However, the proclamation of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, and the subsequent removal of commercial forestry plantations within the park may have direct benefits for the species in the future.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A baseline survey needs to be conducted in order to estimate the population size of the regional population. This is essential to gaining a better understanding of the regional extinction risk of this species.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the elusive Greater Painted-snipe Rostratula benghalensis may number less than10 000 mature individuals, which, together with an estimated continiuing decline of 10% within ten years based on degradation of its wetland habitats, would classify the species as regionally Vulnerable. However, its population size is difficult to quantify in view of its erratic and rainfall-dependent occurrence, and population trends are unkown. As such the species is assessed as regionally Near Threatened until further data are available.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was listed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Following Christidis and Boles (2008), most taxonomic authorities now consider the Greater Painted-snipe to be a separate species from the Australian Painted-snipe Rostratula australis based on differences in plumage, morphology, possible voice, and DNA. Genetic data suggest that the three species of painted-snipes (the other being the South American Painted-snipe Nycticryphes semicollaris) belong to a distinct family, the Rostratulidae, within the order Charadriiformes and suborder Limicoli (Christidis and Boles 2008). As evidenced by their polyandrous breeding systems and the similar colouration of their chicks (Hockey and Douie 1995), the painted-snipes are allied to jacanas (family Jacanidae).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">23-26 cm. An unobtrusive but strikingly marked species. Sexes dimorphic. Both sexes have buffy-white eye-patches framed by darker borders, extending behind the eye, as well as narrow, buff, median crown-stripes. Male smoky grey-brown on breast, head, neck and upperparts, finely speckled or mottled white. Lower breast and belly pure white, extending in broad dark-sided band up breast-sides and onto mantle, where markings form conspicuous, pale ‘V' shape. Scapulars intricately mottled greyish, with bold black and white spots. Wing coverts dark gold, with coarse paler gold spots. Tail finely barred with grey, black, gold and buff. Female darker and plainer, with rich reddish-brown breast and neck and more finely barred, coppery wing coverts. Bill blunt-tipped and slightly decurved; horn-coloured and with a greenish base and redder bulbous tip. Legs greenish olive. Eyes dark brown to yellow-brown. Distinguished from Gallinago snipes by longer legs, shorter bill and pale eye patch and breast harness. The rounded wings could lead to confusion with rallids. Juvenile similar to adult male, but breast appears more streaked than barred, paler above and pectoral band absent (Urban et al. 1986, Hockey and Douie 1995, Rosair and Cottridge 2004).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Greater Painted-snipe is widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, the Nile Valley in Egypt, India, and southern Asia (Hockey and Douie 1995). On the African continent, it occurs widely, but in a fragmented pattern south of the Sahara, except in the driest parts of the north-east and south-west (such as coastal Namibia and most of the Karoo in South Africa); it also avoids the forested equatorial regions of central and West Africa (Hockey and Tree 2005a). In the region, the species is spatially and temporally erratic in occurrence, with its presence and abundance largely determined by rainfall. Its movements are poorly understood and apparently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, even in areas where it is reasonably numerous (such as northern Kruger National Park and the Limpopo Valley), it is easily overlooked. It occurs at scattered wetland localities across much of the north-eastern half of the country, as well as sparsely in coastal areas in Eastern Cape, mainly in summer. A small, isolated and apparently contracting population persists in Western Cape (Hockey et al. 1989). Vagrants or nomadic visitors are occasionally recorded in unusual locations, including in the Karoo and Kalahari.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at 31 000 to 1 000 000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014bt). Obtaining an accurate estimate of the regional population is very problematic considering the Greater Painted-snipe's mobility and secretive nature (Underhill 2000d). In particular, the size of the nomadic population in north-eastern South Africa is likely to vary considerably from year to year, depending on annual rainfall. Although historical descriptions suggest it may have been more numerous historically, changes in its abundance cannot be unambiguously inferred from available literature (Underhill 2000d). The mostly sedentary Western Cape population is thought to have undergone a dramatic decline in the past three decades (Hockey  et al. 1989) and, although once considered locally common in Western Cape, the provincial population may now number less than200 (Hockey and Tree 2005a). The regional population is tentatively estimated at less than10 000 mature individuals, which makes the species a candidate for classification as Vulnerable, but confidence in this estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There is considerable uncertainty as to the size of the regional population, and population trends are not expressly documented. However, several different authors have mentioned that the regional population may be in decline (Hockey and Douie 1995) although the rate of decline is unknown. There has been a c. 42% reduction in the AoO of this species since SABAP1, and this is detectable in the increasingly fragmented distribution as shown in the accompanying map. This reduction suggests a downward population trend, but this may not be valid due to the secretiveness of this species, as well as its erratic, rainfall-dependent movements influencing detection. It is likely that due to the loss and degradation of its wetlands habitat, the Greater Painted-snipe has undergone an estimated continuing decline of at least 10% within 10 years. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater Painted-snipe are limited to freshwater wetlands, where they prefer secluded muddy areas adjacent to con&#173;cealing vegetation (Urban et al. 1986). The species occurs sparsely along the shorelines of dams, lakes and pans, on the banks of slow-flowing rivers, on marshy floodplains, in temporarily flooded grassland, at rainwater pools on clay soils with plentiful adjacent cover, and in other similar locations. Birds often congregate where the water is receding, but vacate such habitats when the water level falls beyond the fringes of vegetation (Hockey and Tree 2005a). Reported occurrence in savannah and other terrestrial vegetation types is conditional on the presence of suitable, usually ephemeral, wetlands (Navarro 1997a). Due to its nomadic and partly migratory lifestyle, wanderers are occasionally encountered at small, isolated waterbodies in arid regions.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The main threat faced by this species is transformation, degradation and loss of its wetland habitat due to increasing human pressures (Navarro 1997a). The isolated Western Cape population is especially vulnerable as much suitable wetland habitat has been destroyed on the Cape Flats, an area that was until recently the core of the distribution of this species in that province (Underhill 2000d). Threats to wetlands include drainage and clearing for development and agriculture, and invasion of bulrushes Typha capensis due to regulation of stream flow reducing the extent of flooding and drying cycles (Hockey and Tree 2005a). Direct water abstraction and damming may also lead to reed overgrowth and salinisation. The construction of farm dams has likely been of relatively little benefit to the Greater Painted-snipe (Hockey and Douie 1995). Other general threats include organic pollution, overgrazing, cutting of reeds and thatch grass, trampling by cattle and disturbance. The potential effects of climate change have not been thoroughly investigated.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No specific conservation measures focusing on the Greater Painted-snipe are currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Monitoring the population trends of this secretive, cryptic, partly nocturnal and nomadic wader is challenging, but more accurate insight into the true status of the species is required before sensible conservation actions can be proposed. The possibility of establishing new protected wetland areas in the range of the Western Cape population should be investigated. Parts of existing protected wetlands known to support this species can be managed appropriately based on the ecological requirements of the Greater Painted-snipe.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus satisfies the criterion for regionally Vulnerable under D2 (Population with a very restricted area of occupancy or number of locations (typically five or fewer) such that it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period in an uncertain future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period). However, it was felt that it was unlikely that stochastic events or human activities at the Prince Edward Islands would lead to this species becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct within one to two generations although there was a possibility that such activities could result in this species being listed as Vulnerable or Endangered during that period. As a result King Penguin was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Within the region, the King Penguin is restricted to only two locations, namely Marion Island and Price Edward Island. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The genus Aptenodytes includes two species: Emperor Penguin A. forsteri and King Penguin A. patagonicus. Two subspecies of the latter are normally recognised, which are separable on bill and wing length: the nominate A. p. patagonicus occurs in the south-west Atlantic Ocean and A. p. halli at island groups in the south Indian Ocean and south of New Zealand (del Hoyo et al. 1992).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">94-95 cm; 9-15 kg. A tall, massive penguin (the world's second largest penguin after the Emperor), with a long, pointed orange-based bill. Adults blue-black above and white below. There are dusky yellow filoplumes on the crown, and two orange ear-patches on the sides of the head, narrowing onto the neck where the colour diffuses onto the throat and upper breast. Bill black with orange or pink plate on lower mandible. Eyes brown. Feet black. Immature duller overall and with dull yellow, not orange ear-patches and all-black bill (Del Hoyo et al.1992). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A. p. patagonicus breeds at Staten Island, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia in the south-west Atlantic Ocean and occurs off the coast of South America, including southern Argentina, during winter. A. p. halli breeds at the Prince Edward Islands (South Africa), Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands (France) and Heard Island (Australia) in the south Indian Ocean, and at Macquarie Island (Australia) south of New Zealand (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Stragglers have reached the coasts of Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1992). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species was exterminated from the Falkland Islands by c. 1870 and from Heard Island by 1948, but both localities have subsequently been recolonised (del Hoyo et al. 1992). On South Africa's Marion and Prince Edward islands, the species breeds at 13 distinct colonies, which are dispersed across the islands (Crawford et al. 2003b; Ryan et al. 2003). Stochastic events, unless exceptionally large, are unlikely to cause the species' extinction in the region in a very short time period.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has not been quantified (BirdLife International 2014cn). At Marion Island, King Penguins breed regularly at 10 discrete colonies (Crawford et al. 2003b) although sporadic breeding events involving less than100 pairs have been recorded at five other locations (Department of Environmental Affairs unpubl. information). At Marion Island, four estimates made between 2008/09 and 2011/12 of numbers breeding in summer (December-January), suggest a population of 69 405 ± 3 417 pairs (Crawford et al. 2009c). At Prince Edward Island, birds breed at three colonies, where it was estimated that there were 2 228 ± 117 pairs in the 2008/09 summer season (Crawford et al. 2009c). Based upon this, c. 69 000 pairs breed annually at the Prince Edward Islands. However, since about 20% of King Penguins at Marion Island do not breed in each season (van Heezik et al. 1994), the overall population is adjusted to c. 90 000 pairs. Confidence in this estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is increasing (BirdLife International, 2014cn). Based on aerial photographs taken in March, Siegfried et al. (1978), estimated numbers of King Penguins breeding annually at Marion Island to be c. 215 234 pairs. Correcting this to account for absenteeism of breeders (c. 20%), van Heezik et al. (1994) considered the overall population during 1974-1977 to be c. 270 000 pairs. Between 2008/09 and 2011/12, estimates of numbers breeding were made by counting incubating adults and chicks at smaller colonies and, at two large colonies (Kildalkey Bay and King Penguin Bay), counting incubators and chicks in a subsection of the colony (sometimes on photographs), gauging the proportion of the overall area of the colony covered by the subsection and extrapolating the count by the proportion (Crawford et al. 2009c). In this period, estimates of numbers breeding averaged 69 000 pairs, equivalent to a population of c. 90 000 pairs. This suggests that the population decreased at Marion Island by 67% between 1976/77 and 2011/12 (35 years), but the months used and methods applied to estimate numbers were dissimilar. Counts of King Penguin chicks surviving to the end of winter (September or October) were made in a consistent manner in 21 years between 1987 and 2011. They averaged 51 900 ± 21 715 and there was no significant trend over time (Crawford et al. 2009c). Therefore, unless there was a trend in the proportion of chicks surviving to the end of winter, the overall population at Marion Island was stable between the late 1980s and 2011. Confidence in this trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">King Penguins breed on relatively flat beaches without ice or snow and which provide easy access to the sea (del Hoyo et al. 1992). At Marion Island, numbers of adults at colonies increase rapidly between September and late October. Most King Penguins moult from October to February and laying takes place from late November to February, the date being influenced by the outcome of the previous breeding attempt (du Plessis et al. 1994). King Penguins incubate a single egg, brooding the small chicks on their feet (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Incubation is by both sexes and lasts 52-56 days, with stints of 12-21 days (del Hoyo et al. 1992). At Marion Island, chicks hatch between late January and mid-April (du Plessis et al. 1994). The overall breeding period, from laying to chick fledging, lasts about 13.5 months (du Plessis et al. 1994), so that only two successful breeding cycles are possible per pair every three years (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding success is 30-50% and birds attain sexual maturity at 5-7 years old (del Hoyo et al. 1992). King Penguins feed mainly on myctophids and squids (del Hoyo et al. 1992). At Marion Island, fish accounted for 87% of the wet mass of food (Adams and Klages 1987). King Penguins forage up to 900 km from Marion Island when feeding chicks (Adams and Klages 1987). In winter, birds often move west of the island to feed, some reaching the Atlantic Ocean. King Penguins may dive deeper than 240 m but mostly feed at depths shallower than 50 m.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Antarctic Fur Seals Arctocephalus gazella predate King Penguins at Marion Island (Hofmeyr and Bester 1993); seal populations are increasing at both Marion and Prince Edward islands (Hofmeyr et al. 2006; Bester et al. 2009). Predation is particularly heavy at two colonies at Marion Island: Good Hope Bay and Kildalkey Bay. Giant petrels Macronectes spp. may take substantial numbers of eggs and chicks. By contrast, the impact of Lesser Sheathbills Chionis minor and Subantarctic Skuas Stercorarius antarcticus are probably relatively minor. An unknown disease killed 250-300 King Penguins at Good Hope Bay in late October 1992 (Cooper et al. 2009). Disturbance from helicopter flights may cause some breeding failure or lead pairs to relocate to alternative breeding sites. Insufficient food may decrease adult survival (Olsson and van der Jeugd 2002). Fisheries potentially compete with King Penguins for food at some localities (Moore et al. 1998). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At Marion Island, no helicopter movement is permitted above King Penguin colonies (but helicopter flight paths do stray near to colonies). There are strict guidelines in place for offloading diesel. No access is allowed to Prince Edward Island except for bona fide research and conservation purposes every 4-5 years. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and are managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Best-practice guidelines for reducing risk of disease outbreaks at islands are being developed by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels; once available, these guidelines should be implemented. Overwintering research teams should be given basic training in the rescue and rehabilitation of oiled penguins. The impact of any proposed fishery on the prey of King Penguins should be carefully assessed before such a fishery is allowed. Consideration should be given to declaring marine protected areas at important feeding grounds of King Penguins.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Black-bellied Storm-Petrel Thalassidroma (Fregetta) tropica satisfies the criterion for Vulnerable under D2. However, it was felt that it was unlikely that stochastic events or human activities at the Prince Edward Islands would lead to this species becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct within one to two generations although there was a possibility that such activities could result in this species being listed as Vulnerable or Endangered during that period. As a result, Black-bellied Storm-Petrel was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the Prince Edward Islands.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two subspecies are recognised. T. t. tropica has a more circumpolar and Southern Ocean distribution, while T. t. melanoleuca occurs on Tristan da Cunha and Gough islands. The taxonomy of the latter is poorly understood (Onley and Scofield 2007), especially in regards to affinities to the White-bellied Storm Petrel T. grallaria. Note that both these taxa are more usually placed in the genus Fregetta.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">20 cm, 50-58 g. A robust storm petrel characterised by a dark line along the mid-plane of the otherwise white belly. Females usually larger than males but otherwise alike. Head, neck and back black or dark brown. Mantle, scapulars, upperwing coverts and flight feathers blackish brown. Rump white. Tail dark. Central underwing coverts white; undersides of remiges plus leading underwing coverts dark. Throat, upper breast, vent and undertail coverts blackish brown, connected by black central line down belly, although this varies from completely absent to very bold. Eyes, bill and legs black. Juveniles similar but has pointed outer primaries and white tips to loral feathers (Ryan 2005p).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">This species has a circumpolar distribution, with recorded breeding sites at ten Subantarctic islands or island groups (South Georgia, South Orkney, South Shetland, Bouvet, Prince Edward, Crozet, Kerguelen, Auckland, Bounty and Antipodes islands). Black-bellied Storm Petrels breed in the austral summer (from November) and can disperse as far north as the equator in winter (Onley and Scofield 2007). Within the region, the species breeds on both Marion Island and Prince Edward Island. It is a common passage migrant in waters off the South African mainland, occurring mainly in spring and autumn (Ryan 2005p).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There is no recent information available. Brooke (2004) estimated the global population size to be 500 000 individuals (250 000 pairs), although Ryan (2005r) provides a lower figure of between 200 000 to 300 000 individuals (100 000-150 000 pairs). It is estimated that there are 5 000 breeding pairs on Prince Edward Island, but the population on Marion Island has not been quantified (Ryan and Bester 2008). Confidence in the regional population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be in decline owing to predation by invasive species (BirdLife International 2014co). However, the regional population trend is thought to be increasing, based on night spotting observations (BM Dyer pers. comm.). </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species forages over the open ocean and associate with land only when breeding (Ryan 2005p). This species forages for fish and small crustaceans in cool currents (Hahn 1998) although they can also forage in a wide range of water temperatures (0-30° C) (Ryan 2005p). They forage in groups, often associating with whales, seals, seabirds or fishing vessels. In South African waters, they are common for two brief periods (approximately 6-8 weeks) during spring and autumn, where they are found along the continental shelf-break (500-1 000 m deep) and especially around the Agulhas Retroflection (Ryan 2005p). Breeding begins in November at colonies on bare slopes, in thick vegetation, in burrows or in rocky crevices on offshore islands. A generation length of 15.2 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014co).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Predation by alien rats, mice and cats at some colonies may be a problem. It is thought that this bird was extirpated from Marion Island due to predation by cats (van Aarde 1980). Since the removal of cats, there is some evidence that this species is returning to breed (BM Dyer pers. comm.). They may be vulnerable to predation by introduced mice on Marion Island. Light pollution from the research base on Marion Island may blind individuals causing them to collide with unseen structures, injuring or killing them (RM Wanless pers. obs.). There is evidence of an increase in incidents of bird strikes at field huts through collisions with radio antennae cables. Incidents where mortalities have been caused by lights on vessels operating in the Southern Ocean have been recorded (Black 2005). Oil pollution events are a serious risk for a species that actively investigates oil from fish/whales, particularly in search of food. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures are underway since the removal of introduced cats from Marion Island, which has proven beneficial to a number of burrowing seabirds nesting on the island. Many general conservation actions and strict guidelines are in place to protect the islands and their native ecosystems. In addition, the Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Eradication of introduced mice from Marion Island should continue, which may encourage this species to resume breeding at this island.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Kerguelen Petrel Lugensa brevirostris satisfies the criterion for regionally Vulnerable under D2 (population with a very restricted area of occupancy, or number of locations (typically five or fewer) such that it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period in an uncertain future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period). However, it was felt that the population of Kerguelen Petrels breeding at South Africa's Prince Edward Islands is unlikely to be impacted by stochastic events or human activities to such an extreme degree within a short time period. As a result, the Kerguelen Petrel was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the Prince Edward Islands. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Monotypic. Previously considered a Pterodroma petrel, but early taxonomists recognised its distinctiveness. Matthews (1942) placed it in the monotypic genus Lugensa, while more recent work indicated it is allied to the fulmarine petrels. Olson (2000) created the genus Aphodroma, but this taxonomic view is not supported by BirdLife International.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">33-36 cm, 360 g. A small-bodied, uniformly grey-brown petrel with an unusually large head, large eyes and very steep forehead. Sexes alike. Head sooty grey, with blackish eye patch and slightly paler forehead and chin. Body, tail and upperwing coverts sooty grey; when fresh, feathers show prominent silvery tips, but appear browner when worn. Underwing dark grey, with pale-fringed coverts. Bases of primaries, as well as marginal coverts, may look silvery at sea. Bill black. Eyes huge; black. Legs and feet dark grey. Juvenile similar (Ryan 2005s).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Kerguelen Petrel breeds at several island groups in the Southern Ocean including Gough, Tristan, Amsterdam, Crozet, Kerguelen, Prince Edward and Marion islands (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Outside of the breeding season, birds disperse across the Southern Ocean (Reid 2002). The core of the species' range is south of the Polar Front and it is a rare vagrant to continental waters. It is prone to occasional irruptions in large numbers, along with other seabird species such as the Blue Petrel Halobaena caerulea (Brooke 1981).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 1 million individuals (Brooke 2004). Barnes and Huyser (1998) reported that Kerguelen Petrel numbers on Marion and Prince Edward Islands number in the thousands, but do not provide a more accurate estimate. Confidence in this regional population estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to be stable in absence of any evidence showing declines (BirdLife International 2014cq). The regional population trend is thought to be positive due to the removal of domestic cats Felis catus from Marion Island in the early 1980s (Cooper et al. 1995). The confidence in this regional trend estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Kerguelen Petrel is a burrowing petrel, that breeds in late winter or spring (Schramm 1986). A generation length of 17.7 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014cq). Kerguelen Petrels are assumed to feed predominantly at night, but observations are confined to daytime feeding involving surface-seizing and shallow dives. Its diet includes squid, crustaceans, fish and scavenged food. The species seldom associates with fishing vessels. </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Predation by alien species has impacted Kerguelen Petrel numbers at several islands including Marion Island (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Cooper et al. 1995). Removal of cats from Marion Island in the early 1980s has negated this threat (Cooper et al. 1995). Mouse predation on burrowing petrel chicks at Gough Island (Wanless et al. 2007, 2012) and the discovery of mouse predation on albatross chicks at Marion Island (Jones and Ryan 2010) suggest mice could be a threat to this species at Marion Island. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures focused specifically on the Kerguelen Petrel are currently underway, but various generic conservation principles are in place at its breeding islands. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013. Various stringent guidelines are in place to prevent pollution, contamination, disturbance and introduction of pathogens or invasive organisms on the islands.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">None, as there are no overt threats to this species in the region. Research on the threats facing the breeding population of Kerguelen Petrel on the Prince Edward Islands is needed. In particular the impact of predation by introduced mice should be investigated and mitigated as a matter of urgency.</p>

However, it was felt that it was unlikely that stochastic events or human activities at the well-managed Prince Edward Islands would lead to the Blue Petrel's conservation outlooks becoming severe within one to two generations. If threats intensify there is a possibility that the species may become regionally Vulnerable or Endangered during that period. As a result Blue Petrel was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>

	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Blue Petrel has a circumpolar breeding distribution at subantarctic islands (Weimerskirch et al. 1989). Outside the breeding season, birds disperse widely throughout the Southern Ocean (Ryan 1997e). The species is an irregular, non-breeding vagrant to South African waters occasionally irrupting in large numbers (Ryan 1997e).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Studying the breeding biology of burrow-nesting seabirds requires accurate identification of burrow occupants and nest status, which can be difficult (Hamilton et al. 1998), and complicates estimation of population numbers. Brooke (2004) estimated the global population of the Blue Petrel to number at least 3 000 000 individuals. Ryan and Bester (2008) provide an estimate of 100 000 birds on Marion Island and 200 000 birds on Prince Edward Island, suggesting a regional breeding population of 300 000 birds. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is assumed to be stable (BirdLife International 2014cp). Breeding success has increased on Marion Island since the eradication of cats in 1991 (Cooper et al. 1995). The breeding population on Prince Edward Island is thought to be stable in the absence of major threats.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Blue Petrels breed in dense, large colonies at the Prince Edward Islands (Fugler et al. 1987). The species shows a distinct preference for burrowing in steep coastal slopes (Schramm 1986). They are summer-breeders and are absent from the islands during June to August (Fugler et al. 1987). A generation length of 11.7 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014cp). Crustaceans, and particularly krill Euphausia superba, predominate in the diet, with fish playing a less important role (Prince 1980).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population decreased due to predation by cats on Marion Island (Van Aarde 1980). Following the removal of cats on the island the breeding success increased from 24% to 64% (Cooper et al. 1995). The Blue Petrel is one of few burrowing petrels for which mouse predation on chicks has been confirmed (Fugler et al. 1987, Wanless et al. 2007). Barbraud and Weimerskirch (2003) suggest that climate change will impact strongly on seabird populations, including the Blue Petrel, after reporting that long-lasting warming caused a c. 40% decline of the Blue Petrel. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013. Various stringent guidelines are in place to prevent pollution, contamination, disturbance and introduction of pathogens or invasive organisms on the islands.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Blue Petrel is known to be vulnerable to predation by introduced mice at Marion Island (Fugler et al. 1987). Eradication of mice would likely improve breeding success and generally restore the ecology of the island (including potentially increasing other burrowing petrel numbers and altering Subantarctic Skua Stercorarius antarcticus numbers and their predatory behaviour on burrowing petrels), and is therefore strongly recommended.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Common Diving Petrel Pelecanoides urinatrix satisfies the criterion for regionally Vulnerable under D2 (population with a very restricted area of occupancy or restricted to a small number of locations (typically five or fewer) such that it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period in an uncertain future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period). However, it was felt that it was unlikely that stochastic events or human activities at the Prince Edward Islands would lead to the Common Diving Petrel becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct within one to two generations although there was a possibility that such activities could result in the species being listed as Vulnerable or Endangered during that period. As a result it was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the Prince Edward Islands. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">At least six subspecies are widely accepted: the nominate urinatrix in northern New Zealand and southeast Australia; chathamensis in southern New Zealand and Chatham Island; dacunhae on the Tristan du Cunha group and Gough Island; coppingeri in southern Chile; and exsul in rest of Subantarctic (Onley and Scofield 2007). Only exsul occurs off the Prince Edward Islands.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">22 cm, 154 g. This medium-sized, comparatively slim diving petrel is slightly larger than the South Georgian Diving Petrel and has shorter, more rounded wings. Legs may trail behind the comparatively long tail. Underparts dull white with a smudgy border between dark cap and whitish throat and dusky collar, extending onto upper breast. Underwing dusky white with broad grey trailing edge and tip. Upperparts black with thin white fringes running to tips of the scapulars, flight feathers and coverts, forming a broken line down back. In fresh plumage, sides of face and ear coverts dusky-grey, merging with black cap. Black bill, sometimes with blue base, has parallel sides and rounded arch. Legs and feet bluish, with a posterior black line down tarsi and black toes and webs (Onley and Scofield 2007).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species has a circumpolar range, breeding on various islands in the Southern Ocean, in four populations, including islands south-east of New Zealand and Australia, southern Indian Ocean islands, Tristan de Cunha and Gough islands, and islands south-west of Chile, including the Falklands and South Georgia islands (Onley and Scofield 2007). These birds are presumed to be sedentary, although large numbers have been reported far from land in the southern Indian Ocean in the early summer (Onley and Scofield 2007).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated to exceed 16 million mature individuals (Brooke 2004). The regional population of the Prince Edward Islands has experienced sharp declines, especially on Marion Island, where domestic cats Felis catus, introduced in 1948, resulted in high predation rates of burrowing petrels (van Aarde 1980). Common Diving Petrels on Marion Island were stated to be ‘widely distributed' in 1951 (Rand 1954);  however, previously monitored nests were not recorded in 1965 (van Zinderen Bakker Jr 1971) and Common Diving Petrels were thought to no longer breed on Marion Island by 1971 (Schramm 1986). Barnes and Huyser (1998), however, estimated the breeding population on Marion Island to be less than25, whereas breeding is only suspected on Prince Edward Island. The regional population size is unknown. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to be stable in the absence of any evidence of declines. The regional population trend is thought to be positive due to the removal of domestic cats Felis catus from Marion Island (Cooper et al. 1995). The confidence in this regional trend estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The breeding season differs latitudinally among populations, breeding occurring between July and December, with a later onset in more southern colonies (Onley and Scofield 2007). Birds nest in burrows in deep soil, sand or scree, under the cover of vegetation, tussocks and moss, near cliff edges (Rand 1954, Weimerskirch et al. 1989, Brooke 2004). The generation length is estimated at 12.1 years (BirdLife International   2014cq). Common Diving Petrels are suspected to breed at the age of 2-3 years, having a 75% adult survival rate, and estimated age in the wild of 6.5 years (Brooke 2004). Common Diving Petrels are monogamous, and lay one egg, which is incubated for 53 to 55 days. Chicks are brooded for 10 to 15 days, and fledge after about 45 to 59 days (Brooke 2004). They are primarily coastal-neritic feeders, diving on average 33 meters for prey, and feed almost exclusively on planktonic crustaceans; however small fish have been recorded in their diet (Payne and Prince 1979, Bocher et al. 2000).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Predation by introduced cats on Marion Island drove the Common Diving Petrel to local extinction by the 1960s; however, this threat has been removed by eradicating all cats by 1991 (van Zinderen Bakker Jr 1971, Bester et al. 2002). Human disturbance by trampling remains a potential minor threat on Marion Island, although this is tightly controlled (Gremmen et al. 2003). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation actions are underway, although generic conservation measures are in place at the Prince Edward Islands. In addition, the Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">None are currently recommended, as there are no overt threats to this species in the region.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Great-winged Petrel Pterodroma macroptera satisfies the criterion for Vulnerable under D2 (population with a very restricted area of occupancy or number of locations (typically five or fewer) such that it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period in an uncertain future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period).

As a result, Great-winged Petrel was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reasons for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Great-winged Petrels breed on the Prince Edward Islands and occur in South African waters in considerable numbers. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">38-42 cm, 590 g. A large, all dark petrel. Sexes alike. Sooty brown patch around eyes and slightly paler, greyish brown patch around base of bill and chin. Undersides of flight feathers often reflect paler brown. Bill short and stubby. Eyes dark brown or black. Legs and feet grey-black (Ryan 2005r).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Great-winged Petrel has a circumpolar distribution in the Antarctic zone (Murphy 1936) and is widespread in the Southern Ocean, breeding on Tristan da Cunha, Crozet Island, Western Australia, North Island (New Zealand), Kerguelen Island and the Prince Edward Islands (Warham 1956). Non-breeding birds disperse northwards into temperate and subtropical waters (Ryan 1997f) being present in South African waters predominantly between November and March. The Great-winged Petrel is common in oceanic waters and over the shelf-break (Ryan 2005r).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated to be 450 000-700 000 pairs (Brooke 2004). The distribution of petrel burrows on Marion Island is not uniform (Schramm 1983) which makes it extremely difficult to extrapolate from small sample plots and obtain an accurate population estimate. Within South African waters, Crawford et al. (1991) estimated there to be 35 000 individuals in summer and 3 500 in winter. Confidence in the regional population estimate for the Prince Edward Islands population is low. </p>
	<h2>Trend justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be in decline owing to predation by invasive species and unsustainable levels of exploitation. Breeding success at Marion Island increased from 0-20% to 60-64% following cat eradication (Cooper et al. 1995). Confidence in this regional population trend estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Great-winged Petrel breeds in the austral winter, preferring sheltered, well-drained slopes with deep soil to nest in. The highest densities of burrows on Marion Island are found in Poa tussock grasslands and Fernbrake Blechnum spp. communities (Schramm 1986). Burrow densities at Marion Island are lower than in comparable habitats at neighbouring Prince Edward Island, probably due to predation by feral cats Felis catus (Schramm 1986). A generation length of 13.6 years is estimated. Birds feed mostly at night by surface-seizing and dipping (Lipinski and Jackson 1989) with prey being predominantly squid, crustaceans and fish (Schramm 1986). Attends fishing vessels with discards and offal being taken (Ryan and Rose 1989) but Great-winged Petrels avoid dense aggregations of other seabirds (Ryan 1997f).</p>
	<h2>Threats</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to Great-winged Petrels on Marion Island was predation by feral house cats, which caused the species to be listed as Vulnerable by Brooke (1984). van Aarde (1980) estimated that c. 48 000 Great-winged petrels were killed annually by cats at Marion Island. The species has been recorded being caught by longline and trawl fisheries in South African waters (Petersen et al 2009a,b). Being a winter breeder makes this species particularly susceptible to predation by introduced house mice Mus musculus (Wanless et al. 2007, 2012) although evidence of mouse impacts on this species are lacking. The unexpectedly slow recovery of the Marion Island population after cat eradication is believed to be due to mice preying on chicks (PG Ryan pers. comm).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures that focus specifically on the Great-winged Petrel are currently in place. However, its breeding grounds on the Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Eradication of mice from Marion Island is expected to have a direct benefit (improved breeding success through elimination of predation on chicks) and possibly indirect effects, through generally restoring Marion Island's ecosystem functioning. This might be mediated through recovery of all burrowing petrel numbers, which could then reduce the relative impacts of predation by Subantarctic Skua Stercorarius antarcticus on Great-winged Petrel adults and fledglings.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Grey-backed Storm Petrel Garrodia nereis breeds on Prince Edward Island and is suspected to breed on Marion Island, thus satisfying the criterion for classification as Vulnerable under D2 (population limited to a small number of locations, which makes it vulnerable to the effects of human activities or stochastic events. However, it was felt that it is unlikely that the species will become severely threatened within one to two generations and as a result, it is assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the Prince Edward Islands.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Grey-backed Storm Petrels are placed in the mono-specific genus Garrodia. However they are considered by some to be congeneric with Oceanites (Onley and Scofield 2007).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">20-22 cm, 48-60 g. A small Oceanites-like storm petrel, similar in size to Wilson's Storm Petrel Oceanites oceanicus and considerably smaller than White-faced Storm Petrel Pelagodroma marina. This black, white and grey storm petrel has a distinctive hooded appearance. Upperparts black, with grey wash across back and upperwing coverts, and grey rump and uppertail. In fresh plumage shows white tips to upperwing coverts and rump. Tail square; grey, with black tip. Upper breast black; belly and flanks white. Undertail grey and white. Underwing, including bases of primaries, pure white, with distinctive contrasting broad black leading edge and dark secondaries. Eye, bill, legs and feet blackish (Onley and Scofield 2007). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Grey-backed Storm Petrels have a circumpolar distribution in the Subantarctic, breeding on oceanic islands including South Georgia, Gough Island, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands, Auckland Islands, Antipodes Island and Chatham Islands (Onley and Scofield 2007). This species is uncommon in the Subantarctic and Antarctic region, remaining in the Southern Ocean year-round and rarely moving north of the Subtropical Convergence (Ryan and Bester 2008). The species' movements are largely unknown and it may be largely sedentary (Onley and Scofield 2007). Breeding is suspected on the Falklands, Stewart Islands and in southern Chile (Onley and Scofield 2007), and on South Africa's Prince Edward and Marion islands (Barnes and Huyser 1998). The species is a rare, but possibly under-reported, vagrant to South African waters.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 200 000 mature individuals (Brooke 2004). This species breeds on Prince Edward Island (Cooper and Brooke 1984) where breeding adults are estimated at 2 000 (Ryan and Bester 2008). Barnes and Huyser (1998) suspect that breeding also occurs on Marion Island but give no estimate of the number of breeding pairs. Confidence in this regional population estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to be in decline due to predation by invasive species (BirdLife International 2014cr). Trends on Marion and Prince Edward islands are unknown.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Grey-backed Storm Petrel is generally found over the edge of the continental shelf and is apparently only epipelagic during dispersal. The diet consists mainly of immature barnacles and other crustaceans, but also small squid and occasionally small fish. It catches prey mostly by pattering over the surface whilst in flight, but also by dipping and shallow plunging. It has been seen to attend trawlers and occasionally follows ships. Its breeding season starts in October or November, with individuals forming loose colonies on oceanic islands, creating burrows in vegetation or nesting in crevices in or among rocks.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Threats to this species are largely unknown. The population is estimated to be declining due to invasive species on breeding islands (BirdLife International 2014cr). Mortality records attributed to collisions with vessels exist (Black 2005).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">None specific to this species, but various generic conservation measures are in place at its breeding islands. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation actions are currently proposed, as there are no overt threats to this species in the region. Predation by mice is a potential threat that should be addressed.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Northern Giant Petrel Macronectes halli has been quantified at c. 750 annual breeding pairs that breed at two locations in the region, namely Prince Edward Island and Marion Island. The regional population trend appears to be stable but satisfies the criterion for regionally Vulnerable under D2 (population with a very restricted area of occupancy or restricted to a small number of locations (typically five or fewer) such that it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period in an uncertain future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period). However, it was felt that it was unlikely that stochastic events or human activities at the Prince Edward Islands would lead to the Northern Giant Petrel becoming severely threatened within one to two generations. As a result, it was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Northern Giant Petrels breed at the Prince Edward Islands and are regular visitors to continental South African waters. The species was listed as regionally Near Threatened in the 2000 assessment. In addition, approximately 6% of the global population breeds on the Prince Edward Islands.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Monotypic. The species is closely related to the partly sympatric Southern Giant Petrel M. giganteus, and debate about the specific status of these two taxa has been raised, with some authorities suggesting that they should be considered conspecific. Genetic analysis indicates two clear lineages, corresponding to the M. halli and M. giganteus designations (Techow et al. 2010).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">85-100 cm, 3.3-4.8 kg. A large, albatross-sized petrel, which is always identifiable by a reddish tip to its massive, horn-coloured bill. There are no differences in seasonal or gender plumage although males are larger with heavier bills (Cooper et al. 2001). The juvenile is a uniform black-brown with adults becoming increasingly paler brown with age, tending to show a very pale head and neck, and a mottled appearance on the rest of body. Eyes whitish, speckled with grey, or rarely dark brown. Legs and feet dark grey (Ryan 2005u).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Northern Giant Petrel breeds on several islands in the Subantarctic zone including South Georgia, the Crozet and Kerguelen archipelagos, Macquarie Island, Auckland, the New Zealand islands of Campbell, Antipodes and Chatham as well as the Prince Edward Islands (ACAP 2010d). At sea the species is wide-ranging, dispersing across the Southern Ocean, and also frequently venturing into continental shelf waters.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at 11 000-14 000 annual breeding individuals which is roughly equivalent to 17 000-21 000 individuals (ACAP 2010d). South Georgia holds roughly 33% of the global population (ACAP 2010d, BirdLife International 2014cs). The 2008 census of Prince Edward Island suggested a minimum of 350 pairs although Ryan et al. (2009a) note that this is almost certainly an underestimate of the total population as nests are easily overlooked. In 2008, there were an estimated 400 pairs breeding at Marion Island. The regional population is at least 750 pairs (Ryan et al. 2009a). Confidence in this estimate is low due to considerable extrapolation used in estimating population size.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has shown both decreases and dramatic increases across their breeding range (ACAP 2010d). Similarly, the breeding population on Marion Island has fluctuated since 1985 with a period of annual increase of 3.9% until 1998, followed by a decline of 9.2% until 2005. Since 2005, the population has been recovering at 24.8% per year (Ryan et al. 2009a). The population at Prince Edward Island, the smaller of the two, remains too infrequently counted to discern trends, but it is assumed to form a single meta-population with the much larger Marion Island sub-population (Crawford et al. 2003b). The count at Prince Edward Island was 44% higher in 2008 than that in 2001. The regional population is assumed stable. Confidence in this trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Northern Giant Petrel is a surface-nesting colonial or solitary annual breeder (Bourne and Warham 1966) which exhibits a strong breeding site and mate fidelity, generally mating for life (Voisin 1988). Birds arrive at colonies in August and lay a single egg between August and early October. Both sexes share the incubation and food provisioning duties (Cooper et al. 2001). On Marion Island, average breeding success increased from 53.6±12.5% in 1983-2001 to 74.1%±13.5% in more recent years (2003-2007) (Cooper et al. 2001, ACAP 2010d). The generation length of 17 years was calculated based on a published estimate of mean age at first breeding and a published estimate of mean annual survival (BirdLife International 2014cs). A pugnacious feeder, the Northern Giant Petrel frequently attends fishing vessels, competing with albatrosses and other species of petrel. Incidentally, increases in population have been attributed to the increased pelagic food sources such as waste available from commercial fishing operations (Voisin 1988). The diet includes fishery discards, offal, seal carrion, seabirds, squid, fish and crustaceans. Adult males and females at Marion Island show segregation in foraging behaviour, likely to reduce intra-specific competition (Hunter and Brooke 1992): males tend to utilise coastal and pelagic habitats, whereas females were consistently more pelagic (González-Solís et al. 2007). Northern Giant Petrel are regularly seen from the mainland, and small numbers scavenge around colonies of Cape Fur Seals Arctocephalus pusillus on near-shore islands.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Commercial fishing activity (in particular, Patagonian Toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides fishery, which tends to be restricted around subantarctic breeding islands), is the primary threat, although the threat from regulated fishing has largely abated; illegal fishing remains a concern of unknown proportions. Potentially 7-16% of the breeding population around the Prince Edward Islands may have been killed by longline operations between 1996-2000 (Nel et al. 2002c). Trawl fisheries, through collisions, also pose a threat to this species. There are no known threats on either Marion or Prince Edward Island although human disturbance at breeding sites near research stations or visitations to breeding sites could lead to a decrease in breeding success or even colony abandonment. A secondary threat is the ingestion of marine debris and fouling from oil spills (ACAP 2010d).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The sub-population breeding at the Prince Edward Islands is small but stable. Monitoring and tracking programmes to assess overlap with key fisheries should continue, and the existing measures to avoid seabird bycatch in the Patagonian Toothfish fishery should likewise continue. The species receives international protection under the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (Annex 1) and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Appendix II). Within the region it is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Publication of Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch on Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (2008). The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan of 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No additional conservation action is recommended for this species because it appears to have been stable since monitoring at Marion Island began.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Soft-plumaged Petrel Pterodroma mollis satisfies the criterion for Vulnerable under D2 (population with a very restricted area of occupancy, or limited to a small number of locations, which makes it vulnerable to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period in an uncertain future, thus rendering it capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period). However, it was felt that it was unlikely that stochastic events or human activities at the Prince Edward islands would lead to the Soft-plumaged Petrel becoming severely threatened within one to two generations. As such the species was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the Prince Edward Islands. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two subspecies are widely accepted. The nominate, P. m. mollis, breeds on the Gough and Antipodes islands while P. m. dubia breeds on Amsterdam, Crozet, Kerguelen and the Prince Edward islands. Both occur in South African waters.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">32-37 cm, 280-320 g. A small-sized gadfly petrel with white undersides and blue-grey upperparts, with a distinctive, prion-like dark M-shaped marking across the wings and back. Sexes alike. Forehead grizzled white with grey-brown crown. Blackish patch around eye with white lores. Nape, mantle and upper back grey. Rump and upper tail coverts paler grey. Inner upperwing coverts medium to pale grey. Remainder of upperwing coverts, outer primaries and lower back dark grey. Inner primaries, secondaries, and outer grey coverts medium grey. Underwing dark grey with exception of whitish inner marginal coverts. Underparts white, with grey band across upper breast. Flanks washed pale grey. Bill black although some birds show white or pale grey band at base of maxillary. Eyes dark brown. Legs and bases of the toes and webs pink; remainder of feet blackish. Polymorphism occurs, with birds showing uniformly dark plumage affecting =1% of the population (Ryan 2005v).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Soft-plumaged Petrel breeds at several islands in the Southern Ocean including Gough, Tristan, Amsterdam, Crozet, Kerguelen, Prince Edward and Marion islands (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Outside of the breeding season, birds disperse across the Southern Ocean (Reid 2002). The species is a fairly common visitor to South African waters occurring from Namibia to KwaZulu-Natal, although it is more common to the south (Brooke 1981).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 5 million mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014ct). Barnes and Huyser (1998) reported that Soft-plumaged Petrels breeding on Marion and Prince Edward Islands number in the thousands but do not provide a more accurate estimate. Ryan and Bester (2008) provide an estimate of 10 000 birds on Marion Island and 20 000 birds on Prince Edward Island, giving a regional population of c. 30 000 mature individuals. The population over the continental shelf and shelf-break was crudely estimated at 12 000 birds in winter and 1 200 in summer (Crawford et al. 1991). Confidence in this population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to be stable in absence of any evidence of declines (BirdLife International 2014ct). The regional population trend is thought to be positive due to the removal of domestic cats Felis catus from Marion Island in the early 1980s (Cooper et al. 1995). The confidence in this regional trend estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Soft-plumaged Petrel is a summer-breeding, burrowing petrel preferring steep slopes (Schramm 1986) covered with Acaena sp. on both coastal and inland vegetated slopes. A generation length of 15.6 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014ct) and is derived from an age at first breeding of 6.1 years and an annual survival of adults of 89.5% (Schreiber and Burger 2001). Soft-plumaged Petrels eat predominantly squid (89% by mass) with crustaceans and fish making up the remainder. Prey is caught by surface seizing and occasionally through shallow-diving or surface-plunging (Ryan 2005v). Although they are infrequently seen behind trawlers (Ryan and Moloney 1988), Soft-plumaged petrels have been recorded foraging for scraps around fishing vessels (Ryan and Rose 1989). Reportedly occasionally associates with marine mammals.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Predation by alien species has impacted upon Soft-plumaged Petrel numbers at several islands including Marion Island (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Cooper et al. 1995). Fortunately, removal of cats from the island in the early 1980s has nullified this threat (Cooper et al. 1995). Procellariiformes, which includes Soft-plumaged Petrel, tend to swallow more plastic than other species (Azzarello and van Vleet 1987) and retain ingested plastic more than other seabirds, primarily due to a constriction between the gizzard and proventriculus, which makes it more difficult for gizzard contents to be expelled (Furness 1985).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures specific to this species are in place. However, breeding population on the Prince Edward Islands are protected. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>

	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the Prince Edward Islands. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Monotypic. Genetic data suggest that populations in New Zealand and the Indian Ocean may differ at subspecies level from those in the South Atlantic (Onley and Scofield 2007).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">18-21 cm, 90-150 g. The South Georgian Diving Petrel is small and short-necked with a comparatively long tail. Underparts white with sharp demarcation between dark cap and white throat, short wide dusky collar and white underwings with pale grey remiges. White crescent curling up behind eye in fresh plumage. Key features include white borders to scapulars that form two distinct lines down back, and white fringes to tips of inner flight feathers and coverts. The stubby-hooked black bill is broad at the base, converging gradually, with short nasal tubes and upward-facing nostrils. Legs and feet bluish, with posterior black line down tarsi and black toes and webs (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Onley and Scofield 2007, Chester 2010).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The South Georgian Diving Petrel has a circumpolar distribution, with three distinct populations breeding in the Atlantic Ocean (on South Georgia and surrounding islets), western Indian Ocean (Prince Edward, Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, McDonald and Heard islands) and around New Zealand (Codfish islands) (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Onley and Scofield 2007). Birds are probably sedentary, but records from Australia and south of Cape Horn suggest some dispersion (Onley and Scofield 2007).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at 15 million mature individuals (Brooke 2004). Rand (1954) reported the South Georgian Diving Petrel to be ‘commonly found' on Marion Island in 1948, but after the introduction of cats in the same year, numbers collapsed. In 1979 only 44 burrows were located in 21 ha (Schramm 1986). In 2011, the first confirmed breeding attempt on Marion Island in 32 years pair was recorded (McClelland et al. 2013). The Prince Edward Island population has not been impacted by introduced predators. However, little is known about population estimates although breeding populations are suspected (Barnes and Huyser 1998, McClelland et al. 2013).</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to be stable in the absence of any evidence showing declines (BirdLife International 2014cv). The regional population trend is thought to be positive due to the removal of domestic cats Felis catus from Marion Island (Cooper et al. 1995). The confidence in this regional trend estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The South Georgian Diving Petrel breeds between October and February (del Hoyo et al. 1992), burrowing at high altitudes on cinder slopes (McClelland et al. 2013). Burrows on high-elevation scree slopes at Prince Edward Island are presumed to belong either to this species or Common Diving Petrel (RM Wanless pers. obs). The generation length is estimated at 11.4 years (BirdLife International 2014cv). Breeding is suspected to start in the second year, and females produce one egg per season, which is incubated for 44 to 52 days (del Hoyo et al. 1992). South Georgian Diving Petrels catch prey by diving, to an average depth of 26 m (Bocher et al. 2000). They feed predominately on crustaceans but will also feed on copepods and small fish (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It is nocturnal at colonies, returning at night from foraging to avoid predation by skuas and gulls (Bocher et al. 2000, Perrins 2003). Diving Petrels are tiny procellariiformes that have traded off aerial flying ability with ‘flying' through water, giving them a very distinctive shape and extremely rapid wingbeats. Their wing area is barely capable of generating sufficient lift for aerial flight, but they are extremely adept at underwater propulsion. </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Human disturbance on breeding islands and introduced predators are the main threats to the South Georgian Diving Petrel (Brooke 2004). The Marion Island population was severely impacted by cats, however this threat was removed when the last cat was eradicated in 1991 (Bester et al. 2002). Despite this, no active burrows were recorded until 2011 (McClelland et al. 2013), showing the slow recovery from cat predation, and perhaps an indication that other unknown threats are preventing this population from recovering. Prince Edward Island is free from introduced predators (de Villiers and Cooper 2008) and although breeding there has not been confirmed, there are no known threats to the suspected breeding population. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation measures are currently underway, but various generic conservation measures are in place at its breeding islands. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation actions are currently recommended, as there are no overt threats to this species in the region.</p>

<div id="_idContainer1436" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Southern Giant Petrel Macronectes giganteus satisfies the criterion for regionally Vulnerable under D2 in that it breeds on two islands within the region (Marion and Prince Edward) and is thus potentially vulnerable to the effects of human activities or stochastic events which may cause it to become Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a short period. However, the populations breeding at the Prince Edward Islands are believed to be relatively secure, and it is unlikely that the species will suffer catastrophic declines in the next one to two generations. As a result, the Southern Giant Petrel was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Giant Petrel breeds at the Prince Edward Islands and is a regular visitor to South African waters. In 2000, it was assessed as regionally Near Threatened. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Some authorities suggest that the two Macronectes taxa should be conspecific. Bourne and Warham (1966) listed the differences in plumage colouration, behaviour and breeding biology (ACAP2011d), while Nunn and Stanley (1998) presented genetic evidence indicating two lineages, supporting the M. halli and M. giganteus designations (Techow et al. 2010).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">80-100 cm, 3.9-4.8 kg. A large, albatross-sized petrel with a massive, horn-coloured, green-tipped bill. Sexes alike in plumage colouration. Head and neck dark grey with body and wing coverts mottled brown. Polymorphic: most individuals of brown morph, but a smaller proportion are white with scattered brown feathers. White morph rarely encountered near Prince Edward Islands. Juveniles uniform blackish brown, gradually becoming paler with age, especially on the head. Legs and feet dark grey. Eyes variable (Ryan 2005w).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Southern Giant Petrel breeds at ice-free sites in coastal Antarctica, Subantarctic islands, the Falklands and along the Patagonian coast of South America (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Cooper et al. 2001). Within the region, the Southern Giant Petrel breeds at both Marion and Prince Edward islands. It has an extensive pelagic range with juveniles, pre-breeders and wintering birds dispersing widely across the Southern Ocean and into subtropical waters (up to 20°S). It is present in continental South African waters in both summer and winter.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at c. 46 800 breeding pairs equivalent to c. 100 000 mature individuals with about 40% of the global breeding population found on the Falkland Islands (ACAP2011d). Ryan et al. (2009a) estimated the total Prince Edward Island population to be c. 1 350 pairs and the Marion Island population at c. 1 433 pairs. The total number of pairs at the Prince Edward Islands is c. 2 783 pairs. The confidence in this estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Currently relatively few published data are available to allow an analysis of global population trends in the Southern Giant Petrel. The population at Prince Edward Island remains too infrequently counted to obtain accurate trends. For instance, the 2008 count of Southern Giant Petrels on Prince Edward Island was 28% higher than the 2001 count, but this might reflect better coverage as well as inter-annual differences in breeding success. At Marion Island, the breeding population decreased from 2 500-3 000 pairs in the 1980s and early 1990s to approximately 1 500 pairs in the late 1990s (Nel et al. 2002a), but has since stabilised. The collapse coincided with the short-lived Patagonian Toothfish fishery around the islands. The decline over three generations approaches the 30% threshold although Ryan et al. (2009a) believes that the population has now stabilised. The confidence in the regional population trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Southern Giant Petrels breed annually in loose colonies, arriving from July to August depending on location and latitude of the breeding site (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Eggs are laid from October to November with fledging taking place the following year in April (Conroy 1972). Although birds show a high degree of fidelity to their breeding island, location of their actual nest site varies (Voisin 1988). The species is an indiscriminate scavenger, with an extremely varied diet (de Bruyn et al. 2007). Birds frequently scavenge around fishing vessels (Ryan and Moloney 1988). The species is long-lived with a generation length of 21.3 years (BirdLife International 2014cu).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat facing Southern Giant Petrels is incidental capture and mortality in both longline and trawl fisheries (Petersen et al. 2009a,b), although the species is less aggressive and thus apparently less vulnerable to capture than the various albatrosses. Plastic ingestion, pollution and human disturbance have been listed as threats (ACAP 2011d). The species is occasionally preyed upon by sharks (Hunter 1984) but this is not considered a major threat.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species receives international protection under the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels - Annex 1 and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals - Appendix II. Within the region it is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998) and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch on Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (2008). The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland and a Special Nature Reserve. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Monitoring and tracking programmes to assess overlap with key fisheries should continue, and the existing measures to avoid seabird bycatch in the Patagonian Toothfish fishery should continue. Risks to breeding birds on the Prince Edward Islands should be fully evaluated.</p>

<div id="_idContainer1449" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Rock Pipit Anthus crenatus is endemic to South Africa and Lesotho, and has a naturally restricted global range and a relatively low overall population density due to its specific habitat requirements. A comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 data suggests that the African Rock Pipit has suffered a 34% decrease in its AoO, qualifying it as regionally Vulnerable under criterion A2c. However, given the incompleteness of SABAP2 coverage in Lesotho and other parts of the species' range as well as the fact that this cryptic and inconspicuous species is easily overlooked, the situation may be less dire than current information implies. Consequently, the African Rock Pipit is currently best classified as regionally Near Threatened. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is endemic to the region and has undergone a marked decrease in EoO and AoO between the two SABAP reporting periods. While the African Rock Pipit is still relatively widespread, climate change models suggest that it may lose a large proportion of its habitat in future.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Genetic analysis confirms that the African Rock Pipit is closely allied to the Striped Pipit (Voelker 1999), which shares the African Rock Pipit's yellowish feather edges and underwing coverts, has a similarly robust build, has a musical song, does not perform habitual tail wagging, and also favours steep, rocky slopes (Peacock 2012). The distribution ranges of the two species are mostly parapatric and mutually exclusive. The alternative genus or sub-genus of Petranthus was suggested for this species (Roberts 1922). </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">17-18 cm, 30 g. A fairly large, compact, stocky brown pipit associated with steep rocky slopes. Sexes alike, but female slightly smaller. Robust in build with strong legs and claws and a relatively short tail. From a distance, looks plain brown except for conspicuous pale supercillium, bordered below by darker band through eye. From close quarters, shows diffuse streaking or mottling on olive-brown mantle. Underparts paler, rich buff to cinnamon, throat and chin whiter, with dark malar stripe. Breast and sometimes flanks with variably distinct diffuse darker streaks. Undertail coverts often show dark centres. Tail feathers dark brown with yellowish green edges; outermost rectrix with off-white outer web and tip on inner web. Remiges edged yellowish green; lesser coverts and alula edged yellow. Underwing coverts buff with broad yellow tips. Bill heavy; all-dark with paler base to lower mandible. Eyes hazel. Legs and feet pale brown. Hind claw short and curved. Juvenile and immature plumage imperfectly documented; probably similar to adult, but more distinctly mottled or scaly above (Clancey 1990, Keith et al. 1992, Peacock 2006, 2012).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Rock Pipit is endemic to South Africa and Lesotho, and possibly western Swaziland. It is considered to be mostly resident and sedentary throughout its range (Clancey 1997b). Except for isolated populations in Northern Cape Province, its range is virtually continuous and no subspecies are differentiated. Its distribution lies mainly south-east of a line connecting Cape Town in Western Cape Province and Barberton in Mpumalanga Province. Centres of abundance lie in south-western Free State, along the mountainous border of Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, and in the interior highlands of Lesotho (Peacock 2006). The species occurs marginally in KwaZulu-Natal. At the western end of its range in Western Cape, the African Rock Pipit's distribution is fragmented and sparse. In addition, several small, isolated populations persist in suitable habitat islands elsewhere, including in the vicinity of Suikerbosrand and Nigel in south-eastern Gauteng, and in the vicinity of Hotazel, Olifantshoek and Groblershoop in Northern Cape.</p>
	<h2>POPULATION JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional (and global) population is unknown. The steep and inhospitable terrain inhabited by this species, as well as the bird's secrecy when not singing, make obtaining accurate population estimates difficult. Despite these difficulties, the total breeding population was estimated by Siegfried (1992) at 5 000-10 000 birds. Based on a comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 data the species appears to have undergone a range decrease of at least 11%. Assuming a concurrent population decrease, the total population may now be in the order of c. 3 300-8 900 mature individuals.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 data suggests that the African Rock Pipit's EoO and AoO have declined by 11% and 34% respectively. However, this may reflect incomplete sampling in the Lesotho Highlands and elsewhere. The confidence in this estimate is low and more accurate population density and distributional data are required. </p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As its name implies, the African Rock Pipit is closely associated with rocky or boulder-strewn slopes and rocky scree. It occurs in a wide altitudinal band of up to 3 000 m in Lesotho (Clancey 1997b), and in a range of climatic conditions: western birds occur in semi-arid karroid vegetation while eastern birds occur in mesic, high-rainfall, temperate alpine grasslands. Throughout its range, it is limited to steep, rocky slopes of mountains, koppies, valleys, gorges and rock outcrops. It requires some grassy cover as well as scattered shrubs or small trees, which, together with prominent boulders, are used as song-posts.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The African Rock Pipit currently has an extensive range (at the time of writing, based on SABAP2 data: EoO 673 495 km2; AoO 116 156 km2). It was not considered a conservation priority in the past, largely because its habitat lies beyond the altitudinal and climatic limits of crop agriculture (Clancey 1997b). However, climate change modelling has identified this endemic species as at risk, and predict that it is likely to suffer range contractions, range shifts, population decreases and local extinctions in the future. Preliminary analyses suggest that is may lose as much as 85% of its climatically suitable range by 2070-2100, and persists in only two of the 15 IBAs it occurs in today (Coetzee et al. 2009). Simmons et al. (2004) demonstrated that two factors that may be detrimental to the African Rock Pipit are its reliance on mountain-slope habitats, and its occurrence in the Succulent Karoo Biome (which, together with Fynbos, are expected to suffer the greatest area loss through climate change). Small, isolated populations are especially vulnerable, such as those in Northern Cape. The African Rock Pipit may be an ideal indicator of the effects of climate change, and requires monitoring in future. In addition, it may be locally displaced by commercial afforestation in the east of its range (Allan et al. 1997b). Given its rocky habitat, the species is probably only marginally affected by grazing pressure and fire frequency.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As this species was previously listed as Least Concern, no focused species-specific conservation actions are currently planned or underway. It does benefit from indirect protection in the form of IBAs and provincial and national reserves, and at least 10% of its population is estimated to occur in protected areas (Siegfried 1992). However, given the predicted range shift due to climate change, the future effectiveness of protected areas in conserving this species should be re-evaluated (Coetzee et al. 2009).</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No immediate conservation efforts are currently required, apart from continued monitoring and the estimation of more accurate demographic statistics. Long-term point sampling at a range of sites, and regular field surveys should be considered to assess the African Rock Pipit's susceptibility and response to the effects of climate change.</p>

However, as a poorly studied, cryptic and easily misidentified species, limited to habitats that are remote and inaccessible, this species is almost certainly under-reported and the apparent decrease in AoO is more likely due to incomplete surveys rather than a true change in population. Nevertheless, given the predicted effects of ongoing climate change on the Mountain Pipit, it is best classified as Near Threatened, and is worthy of immediate and continued monitoring.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Mountain Pipit is a breeding endemic in the region with greater than 80% of its global breeding range in Lesotho. In addition, it appears to have undergone a greater than 30% decline in AoO during the period between SABAP1 and SABAP2.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Mountain Pipit has a complex taxonomic history. The species was originally described on the basis of two specimens collected in northern Namibia, and described as Anthus hoeschi (Stresemann 1938). Subsequently birds collected in north-western Zambia were described as Anthus richardi (=cinnamomeus) lwenarum (White 1946). Finally, specimens collected in the Lesotho Highlands were described as Anthus richardi (=cinnamomeus) editus (Vincent 1951). Based on their similarity in plumage, Clancey (1978) proposed that specimens of editus collected in the summer breeding season in the Lesotho Highlands, and specimens of lwenarum collected during the winter non-breeding season in Zambia, were conspecific. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Further investigation prompted Clancey (1984) to lump all three independently described taxa (hoeschi, lwenarum and editus) on the grounds of similarities in biometrics and plumage (Clancey 1990), with the name A. hoeschi taking precedence. The Mountain Pipit was initially considered synonymous with the African Pipit A. cinnamomeus, but most authors now consider it a distinct species, based on differences in size, plumage, migration, behaviour, voice and partial altitudinal segregation in distribution (Mendelsohn 1984). Genetic analysis suggests that the Mountain Pipit is allied to the Striped/African Rock Pipit sister-pair (Voelker 1999), but this is not supported by phenotypical, behavioural and ecological characters.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">18-18.5 cm, 27 g. A localised, migratory pipit of high-altitude scrub and grassland, mostly greater than 2 000 m. Considered a breeding summer visitor, present from late October to March/April. Similar to the African Pipit in most aspects, and previously considered conspecific with that species. The Mountain Pipit is best distinguished from the African Pipit by its larger size, smoky buff or dusky fawn panels on the outer rectrices, less extensive pale markings on the penultimate tail feathers, more heavily marked mantle, crown and breast, darker buff underparts, and pinkish flesh (not yellowish) base to the lower mandible (Clancey 1990). In addition, in early summer Mountain Pipits breed in fresh plumage, while neighbouring African Pipits are comparatively worn (Ryan 2006). The two species have similar voices, but the songs of most Mountain Pipits are generally slower, and the calls deeper, hoarser and more clearly disyllabic (Dowset-Lemaire 1989). Although some local overlap occurs, Mountain Pipits generally replace African Pipits on high-altitude plateaus above 2 000 m (Clancey 1997c). Eyes brown. Legs and feet brownish pink. Hind claw usually less than13.5 mm (9-14 mm) in length. Sexes alike, but female smaller. Juvenile and immature plumage poorly documented, but likely similar to African Pipit: above with darker feather centres and pale feather margins, creating a scaly appearance; below more heavily patterned, with rounded marks; malar and moustachial stripes darker (Keith et al. 1992, Peacock 2006).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The distribution of Mountain Pipit throughout sub-Saharan Africa is poorly known, although it is currently believed to be a migratory breeding endemic to Lesotho and South Africa. Together with the Drakensberg Rockjumper Chaetops aurantius and the Drakensberg Siskin Crithagra symonsi, it is one of three species that have the majority of their global breeding ranges (greater than 80%) in Lesotho (Barnes 1998). In Lesotho, it is locally common on the basalt highlands of the central and eastern parts of the country, on the Thaba-Putsoa range, Maloti range and above the main Drakensberg Escarpment on the border of KwaZulu-Natal. It is largely absent from the western sandstone-grassland lowlands, as well as the lower-lying Senqu (Orange) River Valley in the south-west. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">In addition, the Mountain Pipit's distribution extends south-westwards into the high-lying habitats of Eastern Cape, where it occurs in the vicinity of Mount Fletcher, Naudesnek, Barkly Pass and Elliot. However, it is possible that its range is more extensive in high-altitude habitats of Eastern Cape, and it has recently been recorded near Queenstown. Elsewhere it occurs locally at Matatiele in KwaZulu-Natal and Golden Gate Highlands National Park in Free State Province. The non-breeding range of the Mountain Pipit is imperfectly documented.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The suggestion that it is a breeding migrant to the Lesotho Plateau and surrounding mountain chains, but winters in south-central Africa, is ostensibly supported by occasional sight records of pipits, possibly pertaining to this species, during passage periods, e.g. records around Kimberley, Northern Cape, in February, March and April (Liversidge et al. 1998). Likewise, specimens believed to represent southbound migrant Mountain Pipits have been collected at Francistown, Botswana, in October (Clancey 1990). However, identifying pipits in the field is notoriously difficult, and the validity of claims needs to be re-examined and verified to confirm this species' status and movements (Mendelsohn 1984). The species is occasionally recorded in winter on its breeding grounds (Ryan 2006), and some observers have suggested that the Mountain Pipit is simply an overlooked resident or local altitudinal migrant; this hypothesis may be supported by a range of possible sight records during winter months in Eastern Cape. It is also possible that ongoing climate change may alter the migratory habits of this species (Simmons et al. 2004). Based on putative specimen evidence, the Mountain Pipit is thought to winter along the Zambezi-Congo watershed in Democratic Republic of the Congo, in north-western Zambia and possibly in eastern Angola (Clancey 1990).</p>
	<h2>POPULATION JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size has not been quantified. Tarboton (2011) described the species as locally common on its breeding grounds, with widely spaced breeding pairs. In optimal habitat in Lesotho (relatively flat, grazed plains) Mountain Pipits can occur at high densities. An accurate estimate of the regional population is not currently possible, although it is thought to number less than10 000 mature individuals. The confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be stable in the absence of evidence of any declines or substantial threats . A comparison of SABAP1 and SABAP2 data suggest that its AoO has declined by nearly 40%, which may indicate a similar decline in population. However, this may reflect incomplete sampling in the Lesotho Highlands. While the regional population is thought to be in decline, more accurate population density and distributional data, and regular monitoring in the future, are required before population trends can be assessed. The confidence in the estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Breeding occurs from between 2 000-3 000 m, and less commonly down to 1 800 m (Clancey 1990), in karroid scrublands, ericoid heathlands and alpine grassland. The species becomes more numerous as the slope angle decreases (Peacock 2006), and reaches its highest densities on flat or gently undulating terrain, but it reportedly also breeds on 30-40° slopes (Tarboton 2011). It shows a preference for areas with short, heavily grazed grass, sparse scrub and recently burnt vegetation. Mountain Pipits generally avoid steep rocky slopes, where they are replaced by African Rock Pipits A. crenatus and Long-billed Pipits A. similis. Non-breeding pipits, possibly belonging to this species, have been observed in dambos in south-central Africa (Keith et al. 1992). Birds identified as Mountain Pipits on migration have been encountered in drier scrub or grassland at lower altitudes.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional Mountain Pipit population is naturally small (Clancey 1997c). Of primary concern are the effects of climate change, which are predicted to have a significant effect on the Mountain Pipit due to its reliance on mountain tops and its restricted range. This species was given the rank of ‘high risk' in a recent investigation of the potential influences of climate change on southern African birds (Simmons et al. 2004). Indeed, of six species whose ranges were modelled, Simmons et al. (2004) found that the Drakensberg Rockjumper (an ecologically similar, terrestrial, insectivorous, high-altitude specialist, sympatric with the Mountain Pipit) was likely to experience the highest degree of range loss (69%) in the next 3-5 decades. This worrying outlook provides strong motivation for focused monitoring and conservation actions.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures underway</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation actions are currently underway, as this species was not previously considered a conservation priority. Much of its habitat is difficult to access and sparsely populated by humans, and consequently free of large-scale transformation. In addition, the Mountain Pipit may benefit from grazing by domestic animals and clearing or burning of dense natural scrub to support low-intensity subsistence agriculture.</p>
	<h2>Conservation measures proposed</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No immediate conservation efforts are currently required. However, continued monitoring, estimation of more accurate demographic statistics and research into the ecology of the Mountain Pipit are recommended. The species may be an ideal indicator of climate change (Simmons et al. 2004). As greater than 80% of its global range is restricted to Lesotho, adequate protection and land-management in that country is paramount for the Mountain Pipit's long-term survival.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Chestnut-banded Plover Charadrius pallidus is believed to be approaching the threshold for regionally Vulnerable under criterion C1 (area of occupancy is estimated to be less than2 000 km2, with a severely fragmented population, and there has been a continuing inferred decline in the range and numbers. The Chestnut-banded Plover is listed as both globally and regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global distribution of this species falls within the region. In addition, it was listed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000 and is listed as globally Near Threatened.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two subspecies are recognised. The more numerous nominate C. p. pallidus is endemic to southern Africa, whereas the rarer C. p. venustus is restricted to Tanzania and Kenya (Urban et al. 1986, Rosair and Cottridge 1995). Some confusion in terms of the species' nomenclature occurred in the past; it was previously considered synonymous with C. (alexandrinus) marginatus, while the current species was known as C. venustus and the southern subspecies as C. v. rufocinctus (del Hoyo et al. 1996).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">15 cm. A very small, pale and short-tailed Charadrius plover of stark, saline habitats, usually identifiable by its single narrow chestnut or orange breast band. Adults differ slightly in breeding plumage. Adult male in breeding plumage pale greyish-brown above and white below, with black lores extending behind eye. White forehead narrowly extends around and above eye; bordered frontally by a black forecrown band and chestnut band extending around sides of neck and across upper breast. Upper border of breast band may show trace of black. Diffuse chestnut nuchal collar. Central rectrices brown to sandy grey; outer rectrices white. Primaries dark brown with white shafts. Secondaries grey-brown with narrow white terminal bands. Primary coverts dark brown, with white tips and margins; other upperwing coverts greyish brown. Bill pointed, black. Eyes dark brown. Legs and feet olive to greenish grey. Adult male in non-breeding plumage similar but black on head browner. Adult female lacks black facial markings and has chestnut (not black) lores. Juvenile lacks all black and chestnut colouration. Greyish breast band usually limited to two ashy or smoky grey patches on sides of breast. Dorsal feathers with dark sub-terminal bands and narrow buff fringes. Bill dark brown (Urban et al. 1986, Rosair and Cottridge 1995, Turpie 2005d).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Chestnut-banded Plover occurs in two disjunct populations: a smaller East African population of the subspecies C. p. venustus and a larger southern African population of the nominate C. p. pallidus. The latter subspecies is endemic to southern Africa, is represented by an estimated 11 500 birds. This population has a patchy distribution along the coast from south-western Angola to central Mozambique, and inland in Namibia (mainly Etosha Pan), Botswana (mainly Makgadikgadi Pans) and South Africa (Turpie 2005d). In Namibia, three sites regularly support 1% or more of the world population: Walvis Bay (on average 7 063 birds or 40% of the world population, in 50 km2), Sandwich Harbour (8 338 birds or 47%, in 20 km2) and Mile 4 Saltworks near Swakopmund (174 birds or 1%, in 8 km2). In Botswana, the Nata River Delta supports on average 188 birds (1.6%, in 150 km2) (Simmons et al. 2007). Migration is suspected between central coastal Namibia and Etosha and Makgadikgadi Pans (Tree 1997a).</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Within the region, the Chestnut-banded Plover occurs sparsely along the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape coastlines, and at scattered locations at inland waterbodies, mostly in Northern Cape, western Free State and North West provinces but occasionally elsewhere (for a summary of recent inland records see Peacock et al. 2014). The Berg River Estuary system on the West Coast, and its associated commercial salt pans, is the single most important site for this species, and is the only South African site to regularly support more than 1% of the world population (181 birds or 1.1%, in 3 km2) (Simmons et al. 2007). Other important sites include the Orange River Mouth (Northern Cape), Langebaan Lagoon and the nearby Yzerfontein Salt Pans (Western Cape), Swartkops River Estuary (Eastern Cape), Barberspan (North West) and various ephemeral pans in the north-eastern Northern Cape and central and western Free State. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">However, the availability of suitable habitat depends on rainfall (except under controlled conditions such as at commercial salt pans), and the movements of this species are complex and difficult to predict. In some areas the birds generally occupy inland sites during the dry season when water levels fall and salinity rises (Hockey and Douie 1995). Some birds reportedly move east from the Namibian coast to breed inland when pans are drying out in autumn and winter, but remain at coastal sites year-round during droughts. Coastal populations in South Africa appear to be fairly sedentary (Tree 1997a). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">SABAP2 atlas data suggest that the distribution has contracted in many areas, particularly in Northern Cape; however, this might in part be due to incomplete atlas coverage, and natural temporal and spatial fluctuations in distribution. The species is mostly an erratic visitor to the Eastern Cape coast, possibly in winters following years with high breeding success (Martin 2001) and is a vagrant to KwaZulu-Natal. It is also partly nomadic and singletons or pairs are occasionally encountered in isolated and unexpected localities (Tree 1997a). It can be locally common in optimal habitat, especially at coastal sites, e.g. a 100 ha area at Yzerfontein Pan was estimated to support 0.06-0.71 birds/ha (average 0.23/ha).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Based on instantaneous counts during the period 1991-2005, the total world population was estimated at 17 830 birds, of which 6 338 occur in East Africa and 11 486 in southern Africa (Simmons et al. 2007). The bulk of the southern African population occurs in coastal Namibia; Walvis Bay can at times hold c. 40% of the world population, and Sandwich Harbour c. 47%. Together with Lake Natron in Tanzania (c. 13.3%), these three sites can, in theory, hold between them almost the entire global population of this species (Simmons et al. 2007). Waterbird counts suggest that the regional (South African) population is likely 416-608 (Simmons et al. 2007) or at times possibly up to 1 000 birds. The only South African site believed to regularly hold more than 1% of the global population is the lower Berg River wetlands and associated salt pans, where an average of 181 birds (1.1%) occur, making it one of the eight most important global sites for this species. Confidence in this regional population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population is considered stable, and it is unlikely that the historical and current distributions differ greatly (BirdLife International 2014cw). Overall numbers, especially in coastal populations, may have increased thanks to the construction of commercial salt pans over the last 4-5 decades (Tree 1997a, Turpie 2005d). Nevertheless, SABAP2 atlas data suggest that this species has undergone a marked decrease in range (25% decrease in EoO; 58% decrease in AoO), especially at inland pans in the interior of Northern Cape. This pattern may be in part attributable to a lack of field surveys in that sparsely populated region, but may also be the result of changes in habitat suitability due to climate change (salt pans remaining drier for longer). Given the scattered and ephemeral nature of this species' habitats, its poorly understood movements, and the inherently small population, ongoing population monitoring is recommended (Underhill 2000e). The global population is believed to be stable (Simmons et al. 2007). Nevertheless, the considerable apparent range reduction suggests that this species may have undergone a population reduction of 30%, the causes of which are not understood, approaching the thresholds for the regionally Vulnerable criterion. Confidence in this estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Chestnut-banded Plover is strongly associated with hyper-saline or hyper-alkaline wetlands, including natural and man-made salt pans and commercial saltworks (Turpie 2005d), often in hyper-arid regions where rainfall can be as little as 20 mm per year. It occurs less frequently around lagoons, shallow-water bays, estuaries and estuarine salt marshes in coastal areas, and rarely in freshwater habitats (Urban et al. 1986) or temporary beach lagoons created at extreme spring tides (Hockey and Douie 1995). It is usually found in areas devoid of vegetation, and only rarely ventures greater than 50 m from the water's edge. Nests are placed on pebbly substrata or on dry mud (Tarboton 2011). The East African venustus race breeds around large alkaline lakes (Simmons et al. 2007). The movements of this species are complex, erratic and poorly known, but shifts in habitat preference have been documented during the non-breeding season, when it is often found in more coastal habitats, usually within 1 km of the water's edge (Simmons et al. 2007). At the Berg River Estuary, Chestnut-banded Plovers are mainly found on the salt pans during summer, but in winter forage extensively on salt marshes and intertidal mud flats as well; this habitat shift may be due to prey availability or inter-specific competition from migratory waders (Hockey and Douie 1995).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Chestnut-banded Plover's breeding and non-breeding habitats are subject to increasing human-induced disturbance and degradation (Underhill 2000e). The construction of commercial salt pans has benefited this species, with these artificial habitats have increased the saline habitat available, and consequently population numbers of the Chestnut-banded Plover (Simmons et al. 2007), a rare example of a specialised species benefiting from commercial activity (Hockey and Douie 1995). It is fairly tolerant of human disturbance but may be locally influenced by salt extraction activities (Hockey and Douie 1995). In addition, the quality and extent of its habitat is in the hands of private and commercial land-owners, and dependent on land-use and management of properties that are not formally protected. Its tendency to nest beside access roads around pans make nests vulnerable, and the increasing popularity of recreational offroad driving on salt pans may also be of concern. Extensive foraging on intertidal mudflats and salt marshes occurs during winter in some areas (Hockey and Douie 1995), and these birds are faced with a different suite of threats, including a reduction in mean annual runoff due to direct abstraction and impoundments, dredging, erosion, eutrophication, pollution and alien vegetation (Barnes 1998). At Walvis Bay, Namibia, pollution in the form of fish oils from local factories and other detritus flushed from anchored ships, as well as siltation are real risks (Simmons et al. 2007). Its specific habitat requirements, small population, and reliance on a few key sites, make ongoing monitoring of the Chestnut-banded Plover essential, and its conservation status should be regularly re-assessed (Underhill 2000e).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation actions are currently in place, but several key sites have been designated as IBAs.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Important breeding and non-breeding sites for the species should be identified and protected, either through formal legislation or collaboration with private or commercial land-owners. With sensitivity towards the Chestnut-banded Plover's specific breeding and foraging requirements, commercial salt production properties may play an increasingly critical role in the regional conservation of the species. Owners, site managers and workers of such properties should be fully briefed on the plover and its conservation. Even an act as simple as temporarily cordoning off an active nest will be beneficial. Disturbance, habitat degradation or detrimental habitat modification at key sites should be prevented. Ongoing population monitoring, preferably through synchronised international waterbird counts, should be undertaken. Investigations into the movements of this species should also be conducted.</p>

	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Evidence of declines in Europe, West Africa and Central Asia indicate that the global population of Black-winged Pratincole Glareola nordmanni has experienced moderately rapid declines in population size. The rate of decline is unknown but is believed to approach the threshold of 30% over three generations that would satisfy the criterion for globally Vulnerable. The majority of the global population overwinters in southern Africa. The global status of Near Threatened is adopted as the regional status. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A large proportion of the global population of Black-winged Pratincole overwinters in the region during the austral summer. In addition, the species is globally Near Threatened and was assessed as regionally Near Threatened in 2000.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">25 cm, 100 g. A highly gregarious, aerial insectivore. Sexes alike. Upperparts dark olive-brown. Chin and throat buffy yellow, bordered by distinctive dark gorget (broken in non-breeding plumage). Breast deep cinnamon, belly white. Remiges and underwing coverts black. Uppertail coverts and base of tail white, forming distinct white patch in flight. Outer tail feathers elongated. Eyes dark brown. Bill blackish with limited red at base. Legs and feet blackish (Tree 2005d). </p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Black-winged Pratincole is a Palearctic migrant which breeds in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, migrating south in the austral summer into Africa and dispersing on a broad front (Kamp et al. 2009). Southern Africa, including Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and north-western South Africa, hosts the majority of the global population during this period (Kamp et al. 2009). Within the region, the historic range of the species has declined dramatically with it being considered a vagrant in areas where it was at one time abundant (Maclean and Herremans 1997b), such as the Karoo and Eastern Cape. On its African wintering grounds, the Black-winged Pratincole is nomadic, responding rapidly to environmental cues such as insect emergences after storms (Cramp and Simmons 1983). The Amersfoort-Bethal-Carolina District, Chrissie Pans and Nyl River Floodplain are listed as the key sites in the region. An examination of atlas data indicates a 42% decline in EoO between the two periods indicating that the former range has contracted significantly. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been quantified at 76 000-95 000 pairs (Kamp et al. 2009). It is extremely difficult to estimate the number of birds in the region on an annual basis and numbers fluctuate greatly (Maclean and Herremans 1997b). In 1991, between 205 000 and 800 000 were seen in a single flock near Kroonstad in the Free State, which was more than the entire world population estimate at the time (Maclean and Herremans 1997b). Confidence in the global population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is in decline (BirdLife International 2014cx). Populations underwent steep declines in European Russia and almost completely disappeared from the Ukraine in 1990-2000 (Belik et al. 2000, Belik and Lebedeva 2004). Overall, the species declined by more than 50% over ten years (generation length: less than3.3 years) (BirdLife International 2014cx). This trend may have ceased since 2000, and the European population represents a fairly small proportion of the global population (BirdLife International 2014cx). Reports indicate that the species is increasing in central and north-east Kazakhstan and south-east Russia (Kamp et al. 2009). Overall declines of approximately 20% are suspected. Confidence in this estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Always gregarious, the Black-winged Pratincole occurs in small groups or large flocks of hundreds or even many thousands of birds (Maclean and Herremans 1997b). It feeds mainly during the early morning and evening, hawking insects in flight (Tree 2005d). Within the region, it prefers open grassland, edges of pans and cultivated fields (Barnes 2000u), responding quickly to insect outbreaks occurring after storms. It is also attracted to agricultural activities that disturb insects. Resting birds often loaf along shallow, sparsely vegetated shorelines of dams and lakes.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has declined significantly during the course of the 20th century (Kamp et al. 2009) although reasons for the decline are not fully understood. The primary threat is the transformation of breeding habitat on the Russian Steppes for agriculture (Cramp and Simmons 1983), followed by human-induced disturbance during the breeding period. The species has an extremely low productivity with 60-100% of chicks dying annually due to trampling of nests by cattle, predation, heavy rain and hailstorms and severe droughts (Belik and Lebedeva 2004). In the region, there is speculation that initially, arsenic-based pesticides, and lately organic substitutes, such as BHC and DDT, used in locust control programmes may have caused declines in this species. The continued degradation of grasslands within the region will also have further negative consequences for this species.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">An International Single Species Action Plan was developed for the Black-winged Pratincole by the UNEP/Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds Secretariat (Belik and Lebedeva 2004) which focuses on the implementation of conservation measures at a governmental and non-governmental level across all Range states. The species is included in Appendix II of the Bonn Convention and is protected under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> <span class="Headsup" lang="en-GB">CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</span></p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Long-term conservation of the Black-winged Pratincole will require healthy functioning of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and environmentally responsible land and pest management practices in agricultural landscapes. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Fairy Prion Pachyptila turtur satisfies the criterion for Vulnerable under D2 (population with a very restricted area of occupancy or number of locations (typically five or fewer) such that it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period in an uncertain future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period). However, it was felt that it was unlikely that stochastic events or human activities at the Prince Edward islands would lead to this species becoming Critically Endangered within one to two generations although there was a possibility that such activities could result in this species being listed as Vulnerable or Endangered during that period. As a result, Fairy Prion was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Fairy Prion breeds on the Prince Edward Islands.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The taxonomy of Pachyptila prions is in flux, and requires robust genetic analyses with large sample sizes to better resolve relationships within the genus. However, the Fairy Prion is sufficiently distinctive that few authorities question its validity as a species (Onley and Scofield 2007). </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">25 cm, 140 g. Prions as a group are easy to separate from other seabirds, but very difficult to separate from each other. They have a characteristic dark ‘M' across their wings and back, contrasting with grey-blue plumage. Their head patterns, dark tail tips and bill morphology may be useful in identification at sea. Bill morphology is a reasonably robust way to separate some species, although there is considerable overlap between all taxa. The Fairy Prion is relatively easy to identify if seen reasonably well: small, with bluer plumage than other prions and dark eye-stripe much more indistinct, thus contrasting less against white supercilium. Bill small and blue, with black lines between bill plates. Central tail feathers dark, outer tail feathers lighter grey and edged with white. Undersides white, except for undertail (Ryan 2005x).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Fairy Prion is found around the Southern Ocean, in three distinct regions: around islands south-east of Australia and Tasmania and all around New Zealand and its associated subAntarctic islands; at the southern Indian Ocean islands (including Marion and Prince Edward islands); and the Falklands and South Georgia islands (Onley and Scofield 2007).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is estimated at c. 5 million mature individuals (Brooke 2004). The Marion Island population experienced major decreases as a result of predation by domestic cats Felis catus, introduced to Marion in 1948 (van Aarde 1980, Schramm 1986). Prior to this, the species was probably widely distributed on both islands in the group. The regional population size unknown, but the species is relatively common at sea around the islands. Barnes and Huyser (1998) listed the regional population as numbering in the 100s, but without substantiation.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to be stable in absence of any evidence showing declines (BirdLife International 2014cy). The regional population trend is thought to be positive due to the removal of domestic cats from Marion Island (Cooper et al. 1995). The confidence in this regional trend estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Fairy Prion's breeding biology has not been studied in the region, but it is unlikely to be different from elsewhere, where it is a summer breeder. This species lacks the filter-feeding apparatus of the bill (comb-like lamellae) that other prions have, and elsewhere it feeds almost exclusively on krill and other crustaceans (Prince and Morgan 1987). It appears attracted to boats at times, but does not feed in association with them, merely following in the wake or riding in the updrafts and turbulence created by boats.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The threat from cat predation on Marion Island was removed by eradicating all cats by 1991 (Bester et al. 2002). There are no other known threats. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">None for this species, only generic conservation measures for the breeding islands. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures are currently proposed, as there are no overt threats known to the Fairy Prion in the region.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Salvin's Prion Pachyptila salvini satisfies the criterion for regionally Vulnerable under D2 (population with a very restricted area of occupancy, or number of locations (typically five or fewer) such that it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period in an uncertain future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period). However, it was felt that it was unlikely that stochastic events or human activities at the Prince Edward islands would lead to this species becoming severely threatened within one to two generations. As a result it was assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Salvin's Prion breeds on the Prince Edward Islands.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Prion taxonomy is in appreciable disarray, thanks to the highly conservative nature of the group's plumage characteristics. Size, and in particular bill size, are key distinguishing features, but these are relatively labile characters and many putative species exhibit overlap in bill size and other features (Cox 1980). The status of Salvin's Prion has generally not been challenged (Onley and Scofield 2007). </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">28 cm, 180 g. A typical prion, intermediate in size and appearance between Broad-billed Prion P. vittata and Antarctic Prion P. desolata. Doubtfully identifiable at sea. Sexes alike. Pale blue-grey above with slightly darker crown. Short, narrow white supercillium which extends from in front of eyes to behind ear coverts. Blackish M-shape over back and wings created by dark grey outer primaries and primary coverts, and diagonal bar from carpals to base of wing and across lower back. Upper back and rump grey. Underwings mainly white with grey outer primaries. Tail tipped black, with outermost rectrices pale grey. Underparts white, apart from heavy blue-grey band on sides of breast, and dark grey tip to the undertail. Eyes dark brown. Bill blue-grey. Legs and toes blue (Ryan 2005y).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Salvin's Prion occurs throughout the southern Indian Ocean and western Pacific. It breeds at two locations, namely the Crozet Islands and the Prince Edward islands, in the southern Indian Ocean (Jouventin et al. 1984). At South Africa's Marion and Prince Edward Islands, it is the most abundant breeding petrel, forming an important portion of the avian biomass at these islands (Berruti and Hunter 1986). Birds remain in the Southern Ocean for the majority of the year, rarely venturing north of the Subtropical Convergence Zone (Ryan and Bester 2008). It is considered to be a vagrant to South African waters, but may be overlooked given the considerable difficulty of distinguishing prions at sea.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to exceed 12 000 000 individuals. Barnes and Huyser (1998) reported the population to be in the 100 000s on Marion Island and in the 10 000s on Prince Edward Island. Ryan and Bester (2008) provide a revised figure of 200 000 on Marion Island and as many as 500 000 on Prince Edward Island, giving a total regional estimate of c. 700 000 individuals. Confidence in this regional population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population is suspected to be stable in the absence of evidence for any declines or substantial threats. Confidence in this regional population trend is low.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Salvin's Prion is a burrow-nesting seabird. It prefers to construct its burrows in steep, vegetated slopes but will also nest in natural cavities between blocks of lava (Schramm 1986). Adults are not tolerant of disturbance at the nest (Berruti and Hunter 1986). Laying takes place in November and chicks hatch in January (Berruti and Hunter 1986). A generation length of 11.7 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014cz). Salvin's Prion occurs singly or with other prion species (Ryan 2005y), and feeds by surface-seizing and through the filtering of prey while hydroplaning (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Prey includes small crustaceans, small fish, cephalopods and chaetognaths (Gartshore et al. 1988).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population on Marion Island was heavily predated upon by introduced cats Felis catus, with approximately 30% of all cat stomachs containing remains of Salvin's Prion while 60% of the 1 224 prey remains identified contained Salvin's Prion (van Aarde 1980). Fortunately this threat has been negated by the eradication of cats from the island (Bester et al. 2002). Chicks are preyed upon by Subantarctic Skuas Stercorarius antarcticus (Berruti and Hunter 1986) which will excavate burrows to reach the nest chamber (Sinclair 1980). It is not known whether introduced House Mice Mus musculus on Marion Island pose a significant threat to the species.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">From a global perspective, the Prince Edward Islands are an exceptionally important breeding site for the world's Salvin's Prion population (Ryan and Bester 2008). While no conservation measures specific to this species are in place, the islands are safeguarded by stringent guidelines for visiting researchers. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures are currently recommended for this species, as there are no longer overt threats in the region. Populations should be monitored regularly, in order to detect any changes in population numbers.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of Cape Rockjumper Chaetops frenatus is suspected to be in decline, approaching but not attaining the 30% threshold, which would qualify it as Vulnerable. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is endemic to the region and according to SABAP data is suspected to have undergone a greater than 30% decline in population size in the 25 year period between atlasing projects. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Cape Rockjumper has been variously placed in the Turdidae, Timaliidae and Picathartidae before being settled into Chaetopidae (Sibley and Monroe 1990, Maclean 1993, Clements 2000, Fry et al. 2000). Dowsett and Forbes-Watson (1993) included aurantius as a subspecies of C. frenatus, in contrast to Sibley and Monroe (1990) who separated C. frenatus and C. aurantius. The split is widely accepted and recognised by the IOC and by BirdLife South Africa. The species is therefore now regarded as monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">23-25 cm, 50-60 g. Male is larger and bolder-plumaged than female. Forehead, crown, ear coverts, and hind neck of male are silver-grey, finely streaked black. Silver supercilium. Sides of neck, moustachial stripe and lores black. Malar stripe white. Mantle, back and scapular feathers silver-grey with coarse black streaks. Rump and upper tail coverts burgundy red. Thighs and vent blackish. Flight feathers black with primaries and outer secondaries exhibiting whitish tips. Eyes orange-red while legs and feet black. Female similar to male but black on the head replaced by silver-grey; malar strip is indistinct, while rump, breast, belly and upper tail coverts are duller (Cohen and Frauenknecht 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Cape Rockjumper is endemic to the region (Cohen and Frauenknecht 2005) and restricted to Mountain Fynbos of the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa (Fraser 1997). Its westernmost distribution is the Piketberg and Cederberg mountains, Western Cape, extending southwards and eastwards to Uitenhage, Eastern Cape (Fraser 1997). The species is absent from the Cape Peninsula despite suitable habitat and climate. Typically sedentary, there is no evidence for earlier suspected seasonal or altitudinal migrations (see Hockey et al. 1989), as families are found in the same territories all year round (Oswald and Lee unpubl. data). The species is separated by 100-150 km from the southernmost Drakensberg Rockjumper populations. The Cape Rockjumper is well represented in the IBA network, being found in all Western Cape mountain IBAs including the Kouga-Baviaanskloof complex, Swartberg, Outeniqua, Cederberg, Boland and Langeberg. Local habitat preference is for Rocky Mountain Fynbos on high slopes and ridges from sea level-2 300 masl (Lee and Barnard 2015). Preference for low vegetation cover explains absence along the southern Fynbos mountain ranges at lower altitudes where vegetation recovers quickly after fires and is often replaced by Afromontane forest (Lee and Barnard 2015). The AoO is given as 5 913 km2 based on presence in SABAP2 pentads (Lee and Barnard 2015). However, it is likely that this AoO measure is an underestimate, as rugged mountaintops are likely to be under-surveyed by atlas contributors, and that the AoO lies between 7 671 and 12 692 km2 (Lee and Barnard 2015). The latter values were calculated from ideal climate space models. The range of the Cape Rockjumper is the most highly fragmented of all endemic bird species in the Fynbos Biome (Lee and Barnard 2015). </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population was estimated at 32 550 - 59 290 mature individuals by Lee and Barnard (2015). This estimate was obtained from lower and upper 95% confidence limits of density estimates multiplied by the EoO estimate of 58 126 km2. Confidence in the population estimate is medium. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The population estimate provided by Lee and Barnard (2015) is a baseline for this species. Their examination of the atlas data indicates a decline of 32% in the number of QDSs that the species was recorded in SABAP2 (38) to SABAP1 (56) with a 31% decline in reporting rates. The gap between SABAP1 and SABAP2 is in the region of 25 years. While the decrease in reporting rates and population decrease is not always linear it is assumed that the Cape Rockjumper population is undergoing a decline approaching 30% over a three-generation period (12.9 years). Confidence in this population trend estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Cape Rockjumpers are monogamous, facultative cooperative breeders, with 2-6 birds occupying 4-11 ha mutually exclusive territories throughout the year (Holmes et al. 2002). Nests are solitary and built on the ground (Holmes et al. 2002). Breeding takes place from October through to January. Predation of nests is high (greater than 60%), but pairs that lose eggs or nestlings to predators in the early to middle part of the breeding season (August to early October) tend to renest (Holmes et al. 2002). A generation length of 4.3 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014da). Supernumerary individuals stay with their parents through at least one complete breeding season (Holmes et al. 2002). Foraging takes place predominantly on the ground, with the main prey item being arthropods followed by lizards and rarely amphibians (Holmes et al. 2002). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Projected range modelling, based on occurrence data from SABAP, has suggested this species is vulnerable to climate change with conditions in the Fynbos Biome predicted to get drier and hotter (Klausmeyer and Shaw 2009). Tight overlap between observed distribution and climate models, with mean annual temperature identified as a limiting factor, suggest this species is in decline due to vulnerability to climate change. Milne (2014) demonstrated that this species had the lowest physiological tolerance to high temperature of 12 species tested from the Fynbos Biome, and climate has been documented to be warming in its range (van Wilgen et al. 2015). However, the increased fire frequency and extent in the region (Kraaij et al. 2012) should otherwise benefit this species through increased availability of low-growth habitat of medium fire ages that this species prefers. It is likely that the mechanisms causing declines are linked to decreased foraging windows, as this species seeks shade and is inactive at high temperatures, coupled with a lower chick survival rate in high temperatures (Oswald and Lee unpubl. data). While habitat loss is a concern, causes of declines in reported ranges for Cape Rockjumper over the relatively short period between atlas projects (c. 25 years) are unlikely to be due to direct landscape transformation through agriculture (Lee and Barnard 2015) as most arable land in the Fynbos Biome had already been converted well before the first atlas period (Cowling et al. 1986). Cape Rockjumpers are susceptible to the loss of eggs from natural predation (Holmes et al. 2002), with Chacma Baboon Papio ursinus and Small Grey Mongoose Galerella pulverulenta eliciting alarm calls (P Barnard unpubl. data). Additional potential predators include Yellow Mongoose Cynictis penicillata, Striped Polecat Ictonyx striatus and White-necked Raven Corvus albicollis, as well as snakes including Boomslang Dispholidus typhus and Cape Cobra Naja nivea (Holmes et al. 2002). The expansion of invasive alien vegetation in high altitude areas may also represent a threat to the species' habitat through transformation and loss of habitat. These areas are more difficult to access and clear of invasive alien vegetation. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation efforts are underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">If this species is losing range due to increasing temperatures, site-specific conservation measures will prove especially challenging given the global nature of the threat. In the meantime, special attention should be paid to those populations potentially most at risk: isolated populations on the edge of the species' range and isolated populations throughout the range. Protected area expansion tools, such as Biodiversity Stewardship, should be used to gain formal protection for sites in critical corridors linking populations and critical habitat for this species, particularly for the most at risk populations. Additional conservation actions targeting habitat rehabilitation and protection in these mountain ranges should include alien vegetation eradication programmes in core habitat areas, and appropriate fire management. Such actions should also target key lowland corridors critical for connectivity and dispersal for this species. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of European Roller Coracias garrulus has declined at a rate approaching 30% which would satisfy the population trend criteria of A2, A3 and A4 (a suspected and predicted population size reduction of 30% over three generations where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible, based on (b) an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon; (c) a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat; (d) actual or potential levels of exploitation). The species is a non-breeding visitor to the region in the austral summer. Based upon its global status, the European Roller is assessed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">A significant portion of the global population, which is currently assessed as globally Near Threatened, overwinters in the region. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two subspecies are recognised, namely the nominate C. g. garrulus from the western Palearctic, and the lighter paler blue C. g. semenowi from western and central Asia. Both subspecies occur within the region. </p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">31 cm, 130 g. A short-tailed, stocky roller with mainly pale blue to green blue plumage. Sexes alike. Forehead and chin white, rest of head blue. Lores blackish. Upperparts rufous brown. Rump, and upper tail purple-blue; outer rectrices tipped black and marginally longer. Lesser wing coverts dark purple-blue; remainder of coverts paler blue. Base of primaries and primary coverts bright azure blue with remainder of flight feathers black to dark purplish blue. Underparts bright pale blue to greenish blue. Bill black. Eyes brown. Legs and feet yellowish brown (Herremans 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The European Roller is a non-breeding migrant ranging from Morocco to south-western and central Europe, Asia Minor and eastwards to Siberia. The entire non-breeding range is within Africa (Herremans 2005b). Birds arrive in the austral spring between October/November and depart again in March/April (Kovács et al. 2008). Within the region, the species is concentrated in the upper-middle Limpopo River drainage, the Lowveld region of Mpumalanga and Limpopo, and coastal KwaZulu-Natal (Herremans 1997a). It is an irregular visitor to Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces (Rowan 1983). The EoO within the region has remained largely unchanged between the two atlasing periods (c. 1 500 000 km2) although the AoO has declined by 31% from 350 820 to 242 120 km2. The species is well represented in the existing regional IBA network. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The European breeding population is currently estimated at 53 000-110 000 breeding pairs. No regional population estimate is available.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is in decline (BirdLife International 2014da) with downward trends being reported in northern Europe. In the past century, the species has gone extinct in Germany, Denmark, Sweden (Snow et al. 1998, Snow and Perrins 1998), and Finland (Avilés et al. 1999). Global declines are suspected to be approaching the 30% decline mark over a three generation period. Confidence in this global trend estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">European Rollers are hole-nesters, making use of natural cavities or abandoned excavated burrows of other species (e.g. Green Woodpecker Picus viridis). Pairs are monogamous, maintaining territory and nest site fidelity for up to three years (Dementiev et al. 1951). A generation length of 5.6 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014da). Within the region, European Rollers hunt from a prominent perch, taking mainly insects including beetles, grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, ants, termites, butterflies, wasps and bees, as well as small invertebrates (Fry et al. 1992). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The majority of threats faced by the European Roller are within its home range states on its Palearctic breeding grounds, as well as on passage during migration. The loss of suitable breeding habitat due to changing agricultural practices is the primary threat in Europe (Kovács et al. 2008). Other threats on the breeding grounds include the permanent conversion of grassland for other land-use types, land abandonment, reduced management of meadows and pastures, destruction of micro-habitats (tracks, hedges, beetle banks, uncultivated land) for large insects and other prey species and loss of large trees that provide nesting opportunities (Kovács et al. 2008). No major threats are known within the region, although prolonged droughts may alter movement patterns and render large areas unsuitable (Herremans 2005b)</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Identified targets for restoring the favourable conservation status of the species in Europe include: 1) maintaining a population greater than 10 000 breeding pairs; 2) restoring the area of the distribution to 1990-levels; and 3) in the short term, halting the decline of the species, and in the long term maintaining a stable population trend for at least three generations (Kovacs et al. 2008). The European Roller is listed under the EU Birds Directive Annex1, the Bern Convention Appendix II and the Bonn Convention Appendix II.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The majority of threats to European Roller occur on its breeding grounds in Europe. No species-specific conservation measures are currently underway within the region, or proposed for the future, other than ongoing monitoring of populations visiting the region in the austral summer. The species' occurrence in savannah and woodland biomes ensure that it relatively well-protected in South Africa's extensive network of state-owned and private game farms including Kruger National Park.</p>

<div id="_idContainer1555" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Only a small remnant population of the attractive Yellow-throated Sandgrouse Pterocles gutturalis, probably numbering less than1 000 mature individuals, persists within the region. In addition to having such a small remaining stronghold, the species qualifies as regionally Vulnerable under criterion C2, in that all the mature individuals occur in a single sub-population. Furthermore, the species does not occur in substantial numbers in any formally protected area, although the unprotected, privately-owned Northern Turf Thornveld IBA (SA009) supports an important population. The species is reliant on crop agriculture, which provides it with food in the form of pioneer plant seeds and fallen grain, nesting habitat in fallow fields, and abundant drinking points (for irrigation). In the Yellow-throated Sandgrouse's case, a tenuous balance exists between commercial farming and conservation: although it is not ideal that the species relies entirely on continued human activity for survival in the region, it would probably become regionally extinct should crop agriculture cease altogether.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Yellow-throated Sandgrouse was listed as regionally Near Threatened in the 2000 assessment.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two subspecies are recognised, based mainly on plumage differences. The nominate P. g. gutturalis occurs from southern Zambia southwards to South Africa, while P. g. saturatior extends from northern Zambia to Ethiopia (de Juana 1997).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">30 cm, 350 g. A large, bulky sandgrouse with a characteristic call. Sexes similar in size, but dimorphic in plumage. Male has yellow throat and supercilium, accentuated by black collar and lores. Chest grey, belly chestnut. Remiges and underwing coverts black. Upperparts grey, washed yellow, with dark sub-terminal marks creating a scaly effect. Wing coverts tinted rufous. Bill pale blue-grey. Eyes dark, surrounded by grey orbital ring. Legs and feet pinkish brown. Female has plain pale yellow face, with dark mottling on nape and crown. Belly chestnut and finely barred black. Upperwings, back and lower chest mottled black, white and brown. Immature similar to female but mottled with finer mottling, plus narrow olive-buff bars on upperwing, back and lower chest (Lloyd 2005d).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Yellow-throated Sandgrouse has a highly fragmented Afrotropical distribution, occurring discontinuously from northern Ethiopia through East Africa, southwards to southern Africa (Urban et al. 1986). In southern Africa it occurs predominantly in Botswana and north-western South Africa with scattered records in western Zimbabwe and northern Namibia (Maclean 1997c). It is exceptionally localised within the region, being restricted to the north-eastern part of North West Province and the adjacent south-western corner of Limpopo Province, occurring from around Brits to the Limpopo River, and northwards to Thabazimbi. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Its movements are not well understood: the species was previously viewed as an irruptive nomadic visitor in the region, but it appears that a stable, resident population has become established thanks to the Yellow-throated Sandgrouse's ability to forage and breed in a transformed agricultural matrix (Maclean 1997c). Farmers report that the birds have been resident since at least 1960 (Blane and Tarboton 1990). While it appears that South African birds are mostly sedentary, birds from Zambia may supplement populations in Botswana during the summer wet season (Brooke 1968, Brewster 1991, Barnes 2000v). </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Its range within the region has contracted significantly since the 20th century (Maclean 1997c), and the species is now absent from the vicinity of Kuruman, Potchefstroom, Zeerust and Middelburg, where specimens were collected in the 1800s (Stark and Sclater 1903, Brooke 1968). A comparison between SABAP1 and SABAP2 atlas projects suggests the AoO has declined from 10 331 km2 to 5 925 km2 representing a 42.65% decline. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as generally uncommon and local (Madge et al. 2002). Blane and Tarboton (1990) and Tarboton et al. (1999) estimated the size of a resident population in an agricultural landscape in the Northam area at c. 300-500 birds in 95 km2, based on counts of drinking birds; extrapolation to other climatically, topographically and paedologically similar areas suggest that the regional population may be ‘thousands to tens of thousands' (Tarboton et al. 1999). However, given the intrinsically limited distribution and apparent decrease in AoO, the regional population may be less than1 000 mature individuals, although confidence in this estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be in decline owing to ongoing habitat destruction (BirdLife International 2014dc). A comparison of the distribution between SABAP 1 and SABAP2 suggests a possible decrease in the AoO in South Africa, which may indicate a similar decline in numbers although the rate of decline is has not been determined. Confidence in the regional population trend estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The ecology of this species was examined during a long-term study by Blane and Tarboton (1990) and Tarboton et al. (1999) in the Northam-Thabazimbi area. The Yellow-throated Sandgrouse is a monogamous, solitary nester with strong pair bonds (Tarboton et al. 1999). The nest is a scrape or hollow in the ground, sometimes a hoof-print, often partly hidden by a tuft of grass or stubble (de Juana 1997). Nesting pairs appear to be clustered, with up to five nests in a 6 ha field, and some nests may be only 40-45 m apart; conversely, some apparently suitable fields are not occupied (Tarboton et al. 1999). Egg-laying occurs April-October, with a peak in June (Tarboton et al. 1999). A generation length of 5.6 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014dc). Based on the well-studied Northam population, average productivity is estimated at 0.42-0.85 young/pair/year; mean clutch size is 2.85, and nesting success is 24.8% including clutches accidentally destroyed by ploughing, or 37.9% if ploughing losses are excluded. The daily nest predation rate is 2.55% (Tarboton et al. 1999). The species inhabits flat plains with dark-coloured clay ‘turf' soils that overlie the basic rocks of the Bushveld Igneous Complex, and avoids coarser sandy or rocky soils derived from quartzite, granite and felsites in surrounding areas (Tarboton et al. 1999). The documented preference for plains near swamps and rivers is thus more likely a reflection of the birds' dependence on fine alluvial soils, than the wetlands themselves; birds drink mostly from small stock-watering dams with a bare, flat beach on one side to facilitate easy approach and belly-wetting behaviour (Tarboton et al. 1999). However, before wide-scale habitat transformation through agriculture, the flooding and drying cycles on floodplains may have been important in preventing full plant succession in natural habitats (Tarboton et al. 1999). Within their South African range, Yellow-throated Sandgrouse almost exclusively forage and nest in agricultural landscapes, and especially in fields left fallow for a season or more, allowing for the establishment of pioneer plant communities which provide abundant food resources; seeds of Amaranthus and Crotalaria species appear to be of particular importance (Tarboton et al. 1999). However, if left undisturbed such fields rapidly revert to thornveld savannah, and after about four years become unsuitable for use by sandgrouse. In addition, foraging and nesting also occurs in recently harvested fields, especially of sunflower and soya-bean, and the birds sometimes forage in recently planted or ploughed fields, with the latter often used as night-time roosts (Tarboton et al. 1999). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">While there are no immediate concerns regarding the conservation of this species in the region (Little 2014), the reliance of Yellow-throated Sandgrouse on current crop farming cycles, especially the availability of and quality of fallow fields, make the birds susceptible to a change in agriculture practices (Tarboton et al. 1999). The winter breeding season coincides with peak ploughing of fields in preparation for planting of spring crops, and a high proportion of nests are destroyed by such activities, e.g. six of 13 nests found in one year were destroyed in this fashion (Blane and Tarboton 1990). The potential effects of agricultural herbicides should also be researched (Little 2014). Hunting (wing-shooting) of Yellow-throated Sandgrouse is not permitted in the North West Province. Provided this law is enforced, the birds should not be at risk. As the birds are known to feed on fallen grains of commercial crops such as oats, wheat, barley, sorghum and soya-bean (Lloyd 2005d), the species may be perceived as an agricultural pest, particularly where high densities occur locally. It may also be inadvertently shot during efforts to control the superficially similar Speckled Pigeon Columba guinea, an established agricultural pest. The potentially adverse effects of climate change, and resultant changes in e.g. farming practices, land-use and levels of bush encroachment, on the quality and quantity of suitable habitat should be investigated. A large number of mines are located within the range of this species, and it is a concern that the footprint of mines in the area is increasing; however, mining properties may indirectly safeguard remaining natural habitat, and provide additional drinking points.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No species-specific conservation measures are currently underway. The Northern Turf Thornveld IBA (SA009) was proclaimed specifically to safeguard the last remnant of the Yellow-throated Sandgrouse population in the region (see Barnes 1998). This collection of private agricultural farms covers c. 56 000 ha in south-western Limpopo, in the triangle between the Crocodile River, Bierspruit River and the confluence of these rivers just south of Thabazimbi; the southern boundary is formed by the road between Bierspruit/Northam and Koedoeskop. A recent review suggests that the Yellow-throated Sandgrouse population is relatively healthy, with the birds having adapted to foraging in fallow fields over the past few years as much of their natural habitat has been transformed into agricultural land, especially through the establishment of centre-point irrigation schemes. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The survival of this species in South Africa is dependent on crop farming, and is therefore linked to education and awareness of private land-owners. Tarboton et al. (1999) identified three key factors that would affect the survival of the Yellow-throated Sandgrouse in the region: availability of one-year fallow fields, timing of ploughing of lands, and availability of drinking sites; all of these can be manipulated in the existing agricultural framework, e.g. by ploughing mainly in the summer non-breeding season, or providing incentives to farmers to establish cycles that promote optimal breeding habitat. Tarboton et al. (1999) suggested that if such management strategies are implemented effectively, Yellow-throated Sandgrouse populations may even have potential to be hunted sustainably, providing a financial motivation for long-term conservation planning. Nevertheless, given the relatively small, fluctuating and isolated regional population, continued monitoring is warranted.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the elusive and range-restricted Protea Seedeater Crithagra leucoptera is suspected to be in decline approaching but not attaining the 30% threshold, which would qualify it as regionally Vulnerable. By virtue of this species being endemic it is proposed that the global status follows the regional status of Near Threatened in future assessments.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Protea Seedeater is endemic to the region. A recent paper published by Lee and Barnard (2015) indicated that the population had undergone a decline in numbers approaching the 30% threshold.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no recognised subspecies.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">15-16 cm. Sexes alike. A large brown canary with a diagnostic combination of black face and chin, contrasting white throat and two white bars on folded wing. Crown, nape, mantle and scapulars greyish brown; back and rump similar but with a faint greenish tinge. Breast, belly and flanks greyish. Primaries, upper tail coverts and tail sooty brown with buff to or whitish tips to wing coverts the reason for its Afrikaans name ‘Witvlerkkanarie'. Bill whitish pink. Eyes brown. Legs and feet grey. (Peacock 2012).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Protea Seedeater is endemic to South Africa and confined to the Mountain Fynbos and semi-arid scrub of Western and Eastern Cape. It is very rare (previously suspected to be absent) on the Cape Peninsula (Fraser and Richardson 1989) although there have been reports from Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens. It is said to be largely sedentary but does undertake make local movements in response to fire, and to flowering and fruiting patterns of Fynbos plants (Fraser 1989, Peacock 2012). Birds are often found in large numbers in areas of recently burnt, former mature Fynbos associated with the release of large numbers of stored seeds from Protea species, but breed in mature Fynbos. In addition to Protea-rich Fynbos, the species is also found in tall streamside bush, forested ravines and gorges, mountain valleys, small forest patches and in semi-arid vegetation at the edge of the Karoo (Peacock 2012). An AoO of 8 829 km2 is provided by Lee et al. (2015) based on reports from pentads from SABAP2, but this is likely an underestimate due to poor coverage of upland mountain areas by atlasers, coupled with low detectability. The AoO is more likely to be closer to the upper confidence interval of modelled range i.e. 17 000 km2 (Lee and Barnard 2014). It is well represented in the IBA network, including the Kouga-Baviaanskloof Complex, Cedarberg-Koue Bokkeveld Complex, Swartberg Mountains, Eastern False Bay Mountains and Outeniqua Mountains. It is less frequently recorded in the Wilderness-Sedgefield Lakes Complex, Southern Langeberg Mountains, Overberg Wheatbelt and Botriviervlei and Kleinmond Estuary IBAs.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">An estimate of 395 257-831 202 mature individuals is provided by Lee and Barnard (2015). Confidence in this population estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">According to Lee and Barnard (2015) the Protea Seedeater has undergone an apparent 32% decrease in range and reporting rates (a proxy for abundance), declining from 81 QDSs to 55 QDSs in the twenty years between SABAP periods. The twenty year period between SABAP1 and SABAP2 (1987-1991 and 2007-ongoing) is a significantly longer period than the three-generation period of 11.4 years provided by BirdLife International (2014dd). It is therefore suspected that the species is undergoing a decline that approaches but does not attain the 30% threshold. Confidence in this trend estimate is medium to low given that Lee and Barnard (2015) suggest from feedback from contributors to the atlas project, that it is likely under-reported. </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Forages in the tops of bushes and small trees, but also on bare ground or under shrubs (Peacock 2012). Diet consist of seeds from a variety of Fynbos species, mostly Protea and Restio (Milewski 1978), and also varies seasonally (Peacock 2012). BirdLife International (2014dd) provides a generation length of 3.8 years.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to Protea Seedeater is climate change with future scenarios indicating a contraction in range, driven most strongly by temperature increases compared to changes in precipitation (Huntley and Barnard 2012, Lee and Barnard 2014). Causes of declines in reported ranges for Protea Seedeater over a relatively short period (c. 20 years) are unlikely to be due to direct landscape transformation through agriculture (Lee and Barnard 2015) with arable land in the Fynbos Biome having already been converted well before the first atlas period (Cowling et al. 1986). Given decreased periods between fires (Wilson et al. 2010), increased fire danger indices due to changing climate (Southey 2009, Kraaij et al. 2012), and greater extent of fires in the eastern parts of the species range (Kraaij et al. 2012) it is likely that these indirect influences of climate change are adversely impacting populations as loss of old growth Fynbos implies loss of food as well as nesting resources (Lee and Barnard 2014). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Core habitats are well protected within a large network of provincial reserves (Lee and Barnard 2015). There are no specific conservation programs planned or in progress.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">It is likely that this species more so than any of the other Fynbos endemic bird species requires a patchwork mosaic of burn history in order to thrive. Burning small patches of old growth Fynbos will result in release of abundant food resources, while protection of old growth Fynbos is also needed to ensure nesting sites and a consistent supply of food both on the Proteas and surrounding vegetation. Loss of food resources where alien vegetation encroachment replaces natural Fynbos is likely also a threat. </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Sooty Shearwater Puffinus griseus is listed as globally Near Threatened due to an estimated rapid decline owing to impacts from fisheries, the exploitation of chicks and possible impacts from climate change. The global status of this species is adopted as the regional status.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is currently listed as globally Near Threatened and occurs in large numbers in South African waters. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">40-48 cm, 700-950 g. A small, dark shearwater with distinctive silvery underwings. One of the most numerous pelagic species in South African waters. Sexes alike. Head and body dark brown with underparts slightly paler than the upperparts. Underwing coverts whitish, streaked grey or brown, forming pale panel on central underwing. Bill dark grey, with blackish nostrils. Eyes dark brown. Legs and feet dark brown. Juvenile similar to adult (Ryan 2005z).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Sooty Shearwater breeds on islands off South America, the Falklands, Tristan da Cunha, south-east Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand (Robertson et al. 2003). Birds disperse widely during the non-breeding season across the Southern Ocean and into the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, both north and south of the equator (Robertson et al. 2003). It is a non-breeding visitor to South African waters, where it is one of the most abundant pelagic seabird off the west and south coasts. It is fairly common off KwaZulu-Natal (Ryan 1997g). Small numbers can occur anywhere in continental waters but the distribution of large flocks is linked to that of pelagic fish schools (Ryan 1997g). It is a vagrant to the Indian Ocean north of 20°S. </p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is extremely large and is estimated to be c. 20 000 000 mature individuals (Brooke 2004) with colonies on islands off New Zealand, Australia and Chile, and the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). New Zealand has c. 5 million pairs spread across 80 colonies (Marchant and Higgins 1990). In Australia, there are colonies on 17 islands (all less than1 000 pairs) while southern Chile has a number of colonies with some up to 200 000 pairs (BirdLife International 2014de) and c. 4 million birds on Isla Guafo (Reyes-Arriagada et al. 2007). The Falklands have 10 000-20 000 pairs (BirdLife International 2014de). Within the region, populations over the continental shelf and shelf-break have been crudely estimated at c. 750 000 birds in winter and 320 000 birds in summer (Crawford et al. 1991). Confidence in the regional population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be in decline (Veit et al. 1997, Scofield and Christie 2002) although the exact rate of decline has not been established (BirdLife International 2014de). Confidence in this trend estimate is low.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The generation length of 12.2 years (BirdLife International 2014de) is derived from the average age at first breeding (6 years) and an annual survival of adults at 93.4%. Sooty Shearwaters feed predominantly on fish, crustacean and cephalopods, caught while diving (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It attends trawlers but seldom enters dense feeding groups, rather diving from the periphery to catch scraps that sink beyond the reach of other species.</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The primary threat to Sooty Shearwaters are pelagic drift-nets which drown up to 350 000 birds annually and, to a lesser extent, longline fisheries (Garnett et al. 2011). Birds have been recorded to have been caught by longline and trawl fishing operations in the region (DEAT 2008). The exploitation of chicks for human consumption accounts for c. 250 000 individuals per year (Newman et al. 2009). Rats have been shown to prey on chicks but the extent is unknown (Jones et al. 2008). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Albatross Task Force teams are working in eight countries (Peru, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Chile and South Africa and Namibia) to reduce fisheries bycatch in local trawl and longline fisheries. Within the region the species is protected under the Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act, 1973 (Act No. 46 of 1973), Marine Living Resources Act (Act No. 18 of 1998): Publication of Policy on the Management of Seals, Seabirds and Shorebirds: 2007 and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) for Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries 2008. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">As with other seabirds threatened by accidental bycatch through the fisheries industries, conservation measures for the Sooty Shearwater revolve around the application of appropriate mitigation measures, monitoring of results, and ensuring that there is continued education, training and publicity regarding mortalities suffered by bycatch.</p>

<div id="_idContainer1597" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Within the region, the Lesser Sheathbill Chionis minor occurs only at two localities, namely Marion Island and Prince Edward Island, which qualifies the species as regionally Vulnerable under the restricted population criterion D2. However, the regional population is increasing, and there are no known threats that have had a severe impact on the species. Consequently its regional conservation status is reduced to Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species breeds on the Prince Edward Islands and was listed as Near Threatened in the 2000 regional assessment. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Sheathbills are a mono-generic family of two species. The Greater Sheathbill Chionis alba (or Pale-faced/Wattled/Snowy Sheathbill) breeds on the Antarctic Peninsula and islands of the Scotia Arc, and occurs as a non-breeding migrant at the Falkland Islands, Tierra del Fuego and the Patagonian coast (Burger 1979). Vagrant (ship-assisted) individuals of this species have also been recorded on the South African mainland on a handful of occasions. The second species is the non-migratory Lesser (or Black-faced) Sheathbill C. minor. Four subspecies of the latter are usually recognised: marionensis occurs on the Prince Edward Islands; crozettensis on the Crozet Islands; minor on the Kerguelen Islands; and nasicornis on Heard Island and McDonald Island (see map). As the species is sedentary there is no genetic mixing among subspecies, except in rare cases of ship-assisted vagrants (del Hoyo et al. 1996).</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">38-41 cm; 450-760 g. A peculiar, all-white, and rather unattractive terrestrial scavenger, that looks like a cross between a pigeon and chicken. Sexes alike, but males are slightly bigger. Entirely white except for pink eye-ring and black bill and facial caruncles. There is a prominent upturned sheath on the upper mandible of mature birds. Legs mottled pinkish or purple and black. The juvenile has a poorly developed bill sheath (del Hoyo et al. 1996).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Lesser Sheathbill occurs at Subantarctic islands in the south-west Indian Ocean. The subspecies C. m. marionensis occurs only at the Prince Edward Islands, a South African territory in the south-west Indian Ocean (del Hoyo et al. 1996). At Marion Island, the species occurs almost exclusively along the coastline, but at Prince Edward Island it also forages throughout the coastal plain (Huyser et al. 2000). However, as Lesser Sheathbills occur mostly within 1 km of the coast and the coastline of Marion Island is c. 72 km while that of Prince Edward Island is only c. 28 km (Ryan et al. 2003), the minimum AoO of Lesser Sheathbills at the Prince Edward Islands is c. 100 km2. Lesser Sheathbills banded at Marion Island have been sighted at Prince Edward Island, suggesting some movement between the two localities (BM Dyer pers. obs.), although this was not observed by Burger (1979).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been estimated at 8 700-13 000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2014df). Estimates of numbers of Lesser Sheathbills at the Prince Edward Islands are gauged from counts of birds undertaken in winter, when birds are not breeding and are most conspicuous. No complete count has ever been undertaken at Prince Edward Island. From 1977-1997, the mean count (±SD) on the east coast of this island was 1 408 ± 153 mature individuals (Huyser et al. 2000). In March 2011, 311 mature individuals were counted on the west coast of the island (Department of Environmental Affairs unpubl. data). Therefore there are probably at least 1 700 mature individuals at Prince Edward Island. At Marion Island, there were 3 600-3 800 mature individuals in 1976 (Burger 1979, Huyser et al. 2000). It is estimated that there were 4 300 mature individuals in 2012 (Department of Environmental Affairs unpubl. data). The combined population of the Prince Edward Islands is c. 6 000 mature individuals. Confidence in this population estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">From 1994-2012, winter counts of Lesser Sheathbills at Marion Island increased significantly (Department of Environmental Affairs unpubl. data). Confidence in this trend estimate is high.</p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is omnivorous, feeding on carrion, prey stolen from albatrosses and penguins feeding chicks, eggs and small chicks of seabirds (especially penguins), faeces of birds and seals, intertidal algae and invertebrates, including terrestrial invertebrates (Huyser et al. 2000). At Marion Island, 64% of birds were at penguin colonies in summer, compared to 35% (mostly in colonies of King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus) in winter, when Eudyptes penguins do no breed (Huyser et al. 2000). Lesser Sheathbills also forage among albatrosses, cormorants and seals, as well as in the intertidal zone, at inland bogs, at meadows and in tussock grass (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species breeds during the austral summer, returning to the same territories. Nest building commences in October; nests are in subterranean cavities in crevices, under lava boulders, in small caves and rarely in burrows of larger petrels, often near penguin colonies, to provide shelter from predators and harsh climatic conditions. Eggs are laid in December and hatching occurs in January. Chick mortality occurs from predation and starvation; fledged chicks are independent by the third week in March (Burger 1979). Adult survival is 0.88 per year (Burger 1979). </p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Starvation and inclement weather can kill fully-grown birds (Burger 1979). Lesser Sheathbills are vulnerable to predation by Subantarctic Skuas Stercorarius antarcticus, especially when foraging inland (Burger 1979, Huyser et al. 2000), but do not form a major portion of skuas' diets (Burger 1979). A milder climate may lead more Subantarctic Skuas to overwinter at the Prince Edward islands, thereby increasing predation on Lesser Sheathbills (Huyser et al. 2000). Until they were removed from Marion Island, Feral Cats Felis catus also killed Lesser Sheathbills (Burger 1979). Competition for food with the introduced House Mouse Mus musculus, which feeds on terrestrial macro-invertebrates at Marion Island (Huyser et al. 2000), has not yet led to a decrease of Lesser Sheathbill at Marion Island. A proposed bait drop to eradicate mice may negatively affect the population, with Lesser Sheathbills being susceptible to both primary and secondary poisoning (Wanless et al. 2010). Decreasing numbers of winter-breeding Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua at Marion Island may have an impact on winter survival, as they provide a potentially important food resource in this period, but numbers of Subantarctic Fur Seals Arctocephalus tropicalis have increased (Huyser et al. 2000). Plastics in marine debris at Marion Island have recently increased (Department of Environmental Affairs unpubl. data). As Lesser Sheathbills are very inquisitive birds, it is not unlikely that they may ingest such plastic particles. Other threats include outbreaks of disease and oil spills. </p>

	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">It is not permitted to feed sheathbills. At field huts on Marion Island, which are usually attended by sheathbills, grey water and waste food are put into outdoor toilets to discourage mice entering huts; other refuse is placed in waste bins that are emptied annually. No access to Prince Edward Island is allowed except for bona fide research purposes about every five years. Strict measures are in place to prevent accidental introduction of mice to this locality. The Prince Edward Islands are listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, as a Special Nature Reserve under the Environment Conservation Act (No 73 of 1989) and managed under the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan 1996. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2013.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Annual monitoring of numbers of sheathbills at Marion Island should be continued. The precautionary approach should be applied regarding possible eradication of mice at Marion Island (Wanless et al. 2010) </p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Abdim's Stork Ciconia abdimii is a non-breeding migratory visitor to the region. The species has been described as locally abundant, and forms spectacular pre-migratory flocks of thousands of birds. However, recent evidence suggests that it is in decline, but the reasons for this are not documented, and it is unclear whether factors adversely affecting Abdim's Stork are occurring on its breeding grounds, non-breeding grounds or while migrating. As a precautionary measure, the species is assessed as regionally Near Threatened; it is hoped that further investigation will provide a clearer insight into the conservation of Abdim's Stork in the region.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global range occurs within the region. In addition, the species has experienced a greater than 30% decline in AoO between SABAP1 and SABAP2. </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">76-81 cm, 1.5 kg. A smallish, highly gregarious stork of open grassland and sparse savannah. The sexes are alike, although the male is slightly larger than the female. Head, neck and mantle black with a purplish sheen; lower back and upper tail coverts creamy white. Tail black. Neck and upper breast black but remainder of underparts white. Upper surface of wing entirely dark, but on underwing shows white on innermost wing coverts and axillaries. Bill yellowish with bright blue base and reddish tip. Eye brown. Bare skin around eye, on lores and on chin vermillion red; skin on forehead bright blue. Legs greenish grey; toes and tarsal joints pinkish red. Juveniles duller and browner than adults (Anderson 2005c).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is an intra-African migrant, breeding in a wide band south of the Sahara from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and Somalia in the east (Anderson 2005c, Hancock et al. 2010). From May to August, the eastern population migrates to southern Africa, with arrival often coinciding with the onset of summer rains in November-December (Herremans 1994). Within the region the Abdim's Stork has been described as locally common to abundant in North West, Limpopo, Free State and Mpumalanga provinces (Anderson 1997b), with localised movements in response to environmental cues such as food availability (Anderson 1997b). Large flocks gather prior to migration in March-April, although some birds have been known to overwinter in South Africa. Comparisons of SABAP1 and SABAP2 data indicate that since 1993 the species has undergone a contraction in its former range within the region. This is particularly evident in Mpumalanga and other eastern areas.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population was estimated at 300 000-600 000 mature individuals (Dodman and Diagana 2006). Estimating the number of birds in the austral summer is extremely difficult owing to regional movements. Although a decline in AoO is apparent, this does not necessarily imply a linear and corresponding decrease in population size. Furthermore, the number of birds in the region may be influenced by environmental conditions throughout the non-breeding range (DG Allan pers. comm) and may fluctuate naturally from year to year. The regional population, that is the number of migratory birds that visit the region in the austral summer, has not been quantified.</p>
	<h2>TREND justification </h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is thought to be in decline due to habitat destruction throughout the African breeding range, although the rate of decline is not known (BirdLife International 2014dg). Anderson (1997b) made mention of declines in South Africa due to habitat degradation which has reduced the amount of natural grassland available to the species. The amount of habitat deterioration has almost certainly increased in the past two decades, which could have resulted in a continued decline in the number of birds in the region. The rate of decline is not known.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Abdim's Stork is normally found in grasslands, sparsely wooded savannah, near pans and in cultivated fields, in groups of up to 100 birds (Anderson 2005c). It sometimes occurs in impressive larger groups of up to 10 000 birds, normally prior to migration. In north-eastern South Africa, the average flock size is 25 (Tarboton et al. 1987).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Migratory species face a diverse range of threats spread across the migration cycle (Kirby et al. 2008). Unfortunately, limited research has been done on the conservation of Abdim's Stork and it is uncertain whether threats causing the apparent decrease in numbers occur on the breeding grounds, on the non-breeding range, on migration routes, or a combination of the above. Habitat loss is believed to be one of the primary threats, mainly from urban development, bush encroachment and agricultural activities (Anderson 1997b, BirdLife International 2014dg). It has been suggested that the control of invertebrates may be a threat (Coulter et al. 1989), although this needs to be investigated in light of recent bans on pesticide use in range states. The species is used for medicinal purposes in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No direct conservation measures are currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species may be affected by threats on the breeding grounds, in the non-breeding range and at stopover sites in between, making it vulnerable to the effects of environmental change on a large geographical scale. Therefore, any conservation actions that may be informed by the research questions proposed here, will need to be implemented in close liaison with BirdLife International, as well as other stakeholders such as the scientific council and working groups of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of Marabou Stork Leptoptilos crumeniferus has been quantified at 340-520 mature individuals, thus satisfying criterion D1 for regionally Vulnerable (population size estimated to number less than1 000 mature individuals). However, the fact that the regional population receives an immigration of individuals capable of reproducing in the region has resulted in the species being downgraded from regionally Vulnerable to regionally Near Threatened. The species breeds only at two localities in the region.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Greater than  5% of the global range of this species lies within the region. In addition, the species was listed as Near Threatened in the 2000 regional assessment.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">1.5 m, 6-7 kg. A huge, unmistakeable, scavenging stork, with a bare, flecked head and bulging throat pouch. Sexes alike in plumage colouration, but male larger. Whitish ruff surrounds the neck, which has a large, inflatable gular sac. Tail, back and flight feathers glossy blue-black. Underparts off-white. Massive bill horn-coloured to pinkish. Eyes sepia to greyish brown. Legs and feet grey-black, but often appear white in the field due to excrement whitewash (Anderson 2005d).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Marabou Stork occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Within the region, it is primarily a non-breeding visitor from farther north in Africa, with only scattered and sporadic breeding records known from the Kruger National Park (Whyte et al. 1993, Anderson 2005d) and one established breeding site in Hlane Royal National Park in eastern Swaziland (Reilly and Wasdell 1965, Monadjem et al. 2012). Birds have also recently started breeding at Pongolo Game Reserve (northern KwaZulu-Natal), with at least some of these breeding birds having fledged from the Swazi population (A Monadjem unpubl. data). In contrast to the rest of Africa, Marabou Storks are largely confined to large conservation areas within the region (Anderson and Herremans 1997). Dispersing birds can cover extensive distances of up to 1 500 km (Monadjem et al. 2008). The breeding population in Swaziland, as well as birds from outside of the region, possibly act as a source for the remainder of the non-breeding population in South Africa. The EoO has decreased by 6.2% between 1997 and 2014, while the AoO has decreased by 26.9%.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population has been estimated at 200 000-500 000 mature individuals (Dodman and Diagana 2006). Barnes (1998) estimated there to be 340-512 mature individuals distributed across five sites in South Africa and one site in Swaziland. The current Swaziland population is less than40 mature individuals (Monadjem et al. 2012). In the absence of any observed declines, the regional population is estimated to be between 340-520 mature individuals. The confidence in this estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>TREND justification </h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Throughout its range in Africa, the Marabou Stork's population is suspected to be increasing, mainly due to the species' ability to make use waste as a food source (BirdLife International 2014dh), although there is evidence of some urban populations decreasing (A Monadjem pers. comm.). Within the region, it is suspected that the population has remained stable over the past three generations. The confidence in this estimate is medium.</p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Marabou Storks are scavengers that feed on a wide range of food resources, including carrion from large mammal carcasses, aquatic vertebrates and human waste (Pomeroy 1975). Despite its extensive distribution, the species breeds only at a limited number of localities throughout its range (Monadjem et al. 2008). It is a monogamous, colonial nester, typically numbering 10-30 pairs per colony (Anderson 2005d). Growth rate of nestlings and breeding success have been summarised for the Swaziland population (Monadjem &#9;et al. 2012).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The removal of predators from large portions of the South African veld may have impacted upon this species (Barnes 2000w). Nikolaus (2001) reported that Marabou Storks are utilised as a food source in Nigeria, although it is not known if this occurs within the region. The Marabou Stork's predilection for scavenging from informal rubbish dumps and waste disposal sites may expose it to harmful substances and pollutants. Likewise, when feeding on carrion it is potentially susceptible to the same extensive suite of threats faced by vultures, such as deliberate or accidental poisoning. As with other large birds, power-line collisions may pose a threat.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are currently no conservation measures underway. The Marabou Stork is well represented in the IBA network, with important sites including e.g. Mapungubwe National Park (SA001), Kruger National Park (SA002), Pilanesberg National Park (SA023) and parts of iSimangaliso Wetland Park, e.g. Mkuze Game Reserve (SA057). Both the current breeding sites are recognised and protected IBAs: Pongolo Game Reserve (SA055) in northern KwaZulu-Natal, and Hlane Royal National Park in eastern Swaziland (SW002).</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">It is recommended that annual monitoring efforts of the breeding colonies at Hlane Royal National Park and Pongolo Nature Reserve continue. Birdwatchers should be encouraged to document congregations of Marabou Storks and submit this information, in order to identify important sites for the species. Additional conservation measures, and the need for them, will be determined by results of the research priorities recommended here.</p>

<div id="_idContainer1633" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional population of the near-endemic Neergaard's Sunbird Cinnyris neergaardi has not been quantified. Conservation concern for this species stems largely from its globally restricted range as well as ongoing habitat loss, which may have led to population declines. A precautionary approach warrants that the species be listed as regionally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Neergaard's Sunbird is one of four species with a global range of less than50 000 km2 defining the South-east African Coast Endemic Bird Area (Stattersfield et al. 1998). In addition, the species is currently listed as globally Near Threatened and it was also listed as Near Threatened in the 2000 regional assessment.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no notable issues. The species is monotypic.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">11 cm, 6 g. A tiny sunbird restricted to subtropical thickets in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Sexes dimorphic in plumage colouration. Male mostly iridescent green above (including on lesser and median wing coverts), with iridescent blue uppertail coverts. Tail blackish. Greater wing coverts and remiges blackish brown. Throat and upper breast green, bordered by narrow iridescent violet-blue band and broader crimson-red breast band. Remainder of underparts sooty brown to blackish. Normally obscured pectoral tufts yellow. Bill black, fairly short and only slightly decurved. Eyes dark brown. Legs and feet black. Female grey-brown above, with whitish supercilium. Underparts grey-buff and unstreaked. Central belly with faint yellow wash. Juvenile similar to female, but gape flanges prominently yellow (Brown 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Neergaard's Sunbird is endemic to southern Africa, where it is found along the eastern littoral from Inhambane Province in Mozambique, south to the western shores of Lake St Lucia in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Johnson 1997, Parker 1999, Allan 2000f). More than 80% of its global range lies in Mozambique, where it occurs primarily south of the Save River (extending slightly north of the Save into Sofala Province (Parker 2005). The Mozambique population is divided into two widely separated sub-populations, isolated by the Inkomati and Limpopo River floodplains: a southern population (south of Maputo and contiguous with populations in northern KwaZulu-Natal) occurs mainly in Sand Forest, while a much larger northern population (extending from about Panda, Inhambane northwards) occurs in mixed woodlands away from the coast (Parker 1999, Cheke and Mann 2001). Within KwaZulu-Natal, Neergaard's Sunbird is found mainly in stands of coastal sand forest (Johnson 1997), from the Mozambique border in the north to about Hluhluwe in the south. Previous reports mentioned its occurrence south to St Lucia or even Richards Bay, but this is not confirmed by SABAP2 atlas data. The species is well represented in the regional IBA network with populations in Mkuze Game Reserve, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park complex, Ndumo Game Reserve, and Tembe Elephant Park.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No accurate population estimates exist for Neergaard's Sunbird in South Africa, but it generally uncommon and highly localised and elusive. Numbers estimated for individual IBAs (Johnson et al. 1998) are: 80-120 pairs (160-240 birds) in Ndumo Game Reserve; 20-50 birds in Pongola Nature Reserve; ‘100s' of breeding pairs in Mkuze Game Reserve; and 100-150 pairs (200-400 birds) in iSimangaliso Wetland Park. These figures suggest a minimum regional population, inside these four IBAs, of c. 290-495 pairs, or 580-1 090 birds. Proportions of the species' range are in remote and poorly explored areas, so it is reasonable to assume that it is widely under-recorded, especially outside of protected areas. Consequently the regional population may be 2-3 times the estimate given above and in the region of 3 000 mature individuals. The species is described as common in southern Mozambique, with a population probably exceeding 5 000 individuals (Parker 1999). Confidence in the regional estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be in decline due to reductions in habitat extent and quality (BirdLife International 2014di). Too little is known of the global or regional population in order to provide an accurate trend estimate although it is suspected that the regional population is undergoing a decline due to habitat loss, and based on apparent decreases in Area of Occupancy. Confidence in the regional trend estimate is low.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Populations in KwaZulu-Natal mostly inhabit Coastal Sand Forest (Johnson et al. 1998), where the species occurs singly or in pairs in the upper and middle canopy. It is attracted to rich nectar sources, where it is often driven away by larger and more dominant sunbirds. Main nectar sources are creepers, epiphytes, mistletoes and trees, with species varying seasonally. The diet is supplemented by insects and spiders (Brown 2005).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Allan (2000f) mentions that the species is likely to have suffered from habitat loss in areas outside protected reserves, particularly in densely settled and crop-farming (especially sugarcane) areas. Birds in Tembe Elephant Park may be at risk due to habitat modification by elephants (A Marchant pers. comm.). Concern for the conservation of Neergaard's Sunbird is mainly based on its very restricted global range, which means that any significant decline could prove to be disastrous. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. The establishment of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park complex, as well as the ongoing protection afforded by Mkuze and Ndumo game reserves will have secured the long-term conservation of this species in the region.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Data on population size is crucial for a complete assessment of the species status. Ongoing monitoring in the core populations would enable such population estimates.</p>

	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Orange Ground Thrush Zoothera gurneyi is restricted to scattered fragments of Afrotropical forest in South Africa and Swaziland. Within the region the species is suspected to have undergone a population decline which, together with an AoO less than2 000 km2, means that it approaches the thresholds for the criteria for regionally Vulnerable. </p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Orange Ground Thrush was listed as regionally Near Threatened in the 2000 assessment.</p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Two races are recognised: gurneyi occurs in South Africa's Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, while disruptans extends from Mpumalanga and Limpopo north into Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The species is alternatively placed in the genus Geokichla.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">21-23 cm, 64 g. A colourful but surprisingly cryptic forest thrush. Sexes alike, but female slightly larger. Crown, mantle, scapulars, flight feathers and tail olive-brown. Black greater and median wing coverts tipped white, forming two conspicuous white wing bars. Underparts and lores orange. Belly and vent white. Outer rectrices have narrow white tips when fresh. Bill black. Eyes brown, surrounded by striking white ring. Legs and feet flesh coloured. Juvenile as adult, but spotted buff above, and mottled below (Oatley 2005).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Orange Ground Thrush has a wide but highly fragmented Afrotropical distribution extending from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to South Africa. An isolated population occurs in the highlands of Angola (Mills et al. 2011). Within the region, it is found in Afromontane forests from the Soutpansberg in Limpopo Province, through KwaZulu-Natal and as far south as the Amatola Mountains, Eastern Cape. In Swaziland it is known only from Mgwayiza Forest in Malolotja Nature Reserve (Boycott and Monadjem 1998). The species is largely sedentary, with local seasonal movements possibly dictated by soil moisture and related prey availability (Earlé and Oatley 1983). The bird is suspected to undertake altitudinal migrations (Quickelberge 1989), although Oatley (2005) makes mention that these movements may be ascribed to juvenile dispersal or drought conditions. The EoO provided by SABAP2 is 23 7089 km2 which represents a decrease of 5.7% since 1997. The AoO has decreased from 24 624 km2 to 14 379 km2, a decrease of 41% between reporting periods. Significantly, forest vegetation types covered only 10.9% of the pentads including the species, meaning that the actual AoO is closer to 1 564 km2.</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be scarce to locally common (Urban et al. 1986). A density of 4 pairs/4.5 ha has been recorded in prime habitat (Earlé and Oatley 1983). The regional population is estimated to be in the region of 5 000 mature individuals.  The size of the Swaziland population is unknown but unlikely to exceed 40 pairs (Monadjem et al. 2003). Confidence in this regional population estimate is low.</p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population is suspected to be in decline due to habitat loss but the rate of decline is unknown (BirdLife International 2014dj). In the absence of regional population estimates it is not possible to obtain an accurate regional population trend. An examination of the change in regional AoO (41%) and assuming that, for a habitat-restricted species, a decline in AoO would be mirrored by a population decline, indicates that the regional population may be in decline. It is not know whether this decline exceeds the 30% threshold to quality this species as Vulnerable. Confidence in this regional population trend is medium. </p>
	<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species is a territorial, monogamous, solitary breeder (Earlé and Oatley 1983) with territories in optimal habitat in the order of 1 ha. Egg-laying peaks in October-November (Earlé and Oatley 1983). The Orange Ground Thrush is a terrestrial forager (Earlé and Oatley 1983), focusing on invertebrates, and leaf-litter arthropods (Oatley 2005).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Habitat loss is the primary threat to this species, particularly as it is highly localised and naturally restricted to a geographically limited vegetation type. Trampling and grazing by livestock entering forests is considered to be lesser threat (Allan 2000g). Through their dung, hides and hooves, livestock animals also introduce weeds and pioneer plants along forest clearings and pathways; it is thought that establishment of a dense, weedy understorey layer will be detrimental to the Orange Ground Thrush and other terrestrial forest insectivores. Additionally, animals may create additional paths and serve to open up the forest, which allows more sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor and exacerbates the establishment of a dense understorey devoid of leaf-litter. Additional threats to indigenous forests include degradation through clearing for cultivation, harvesting of forest plants for traditional medicine purposes, and removal of wood for fuel or building materials. Indigenous forest corridors may be damaged during harvesting of adjacent alien commercial plantations (Allan 2000g). Swaziland's Mgwayiza Forest, despite being located within a protected area, is facing threats from mining (Monadjem et al. 2003). </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species protected under the Swaziland Game Act but otherwise no species-specific conservation measures are currently underway. </p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The ongoing protection fragmented patches of Afromontane Forest distributed along the south-eastern and Eastern Escarpment is essential for the protection of this species. Many of the forests where it occurs are nominally protected, and a full review of its conservation status is recommended. </p>

<div id="_idContainer1658" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The global population of the endemic Knysna Woodpecker Camphetera notata is thought to be undergoing a decline in numbers although the rate of decline is unknown. The decline is expected to be concomitant with habitat loss occurring within its Eastern Cape stronghold. The species is assessed as globally Near Threatened.</p>
	<h2>Reason for inclusion in the assessment</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Brooke (1984) considered the Knysna Woodpecker neither rare nor vulnerable, but recommended careful monitoring, particularly in light of its endemism to the region. The species was listed as Near Threatened in the 2000 regional assessment and is also currently listed as globally Near Threatened. </p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">Clancey (1958) proposed that the taxon C. n. relicta be adopted as a subspecies representing smaller, darker and more heavily spotted populations in coastal forests, east of the Kei River, although this classification has not been generally recognised (Short 1982, Fry et al. 1988, Tarboton 2005b). Based on similarities in plumage and morphology, Clancey (1958) further suggested that this species and the Golden-tailed Woodpecker C. abingoni may be conspecific; where their ranges marginally overlap in southern KwaZulu-Natal and adjacent Eastern Cape a narrow hybridisation zone may exist (Tarboton 2005b). Roberts (1922) suggested that the Knysna Woodpecker should be placed in a monotypic genus, Notopicus, based on its different style of colouration, longer tail to wing ratio and more rounded wing shape.</p>
	<h2>Identification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">20-21 cm, 70 g. An attractive, heavily patterned woodpecker of forest and well-developed thickets. Sexes differ in head markings and bill length. Back, wings and rump dark green with dull yellow spotting and streaking. Tail yellowish olive with yellow barring; feather shafts brownish or golden yellow. Underparts whitish and heavily spotted, forming an incipient gorget in eastern populations. Crown and forehead black with crimson speckling. Malar stripe is black with red speckling. Lores and ear coverts white with heavy speckling. Bill entirely black. Adult female resembles male but crown and forehead olive with fine yellow spotting; malar stripe black with white speckling. Juvenile similar to adult with dimorphic head pattern already apparent (Tarboton 2005b).</p>
	<h2>Distribution</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Knysna Woodpecker is endemic to South Africa where it occurs along the coastal plain of the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, and marginally in southern KwaZulu-Natal. Uys and Macleod (1967) cite the De Hoop area near Bredasdorp as the westernmost limit, but recent atlas data suggest the species occurs further west towards Caledon; unsubstantiated records from even further west are intriguing and it should be borne in mind that it is known to occupy and breed in stands of alien trees so may benefit locally from afforestation. Its range in KwaZulu-Natal has contracted: early records from Illovo and Ifafa, c. 80 km north of it currently known limit at Oribi Gorge inland of Port Shepstone, indicate that it was historically more widespread (Clancey 1958, Schmidt 1961, Nichols 1983). Range retractions in KwaZulu-Natal were attributed to clearance of coastal bush for sugar cane farming (Nichols 1983). It also extends inland in dry and often xerophilous scrub-forest habitats (Clancey 1958), and is found inland as far as Queenstown, Somerset East and near Graaff-Reinet in the Eastern Cape; reportedly, specimens were taken as far north as Colesberg in the 1800s (Clancey 1958). It is sedentary throughout its range and there is no evidence of seasonal movements (Tarboton 1997b). The species is recorded from 16 Important Bird Areas (Barnes 1998).</p>
	<h2>Population justification</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The regional (and global) population is estimated at 1 000 to 3 300 mature individuals by BirdLife International (2014dk). Siegfried (1992) estimated the population at 1 500-5 000, of which 1 000-1 500 occur in protected areas. Confidence in this regional population estimate is low. </p>
	<h2>Population trend JUSTIFICATION</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">There are no data from which to generate population trend estimates. However loss of habitat within the species' stronghold in Eastern Cape could indicate a concomitant population decline. The rate of decline is unknown.</p>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US"> </p>
	<h2>Ecology</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The Knysna Woodpecker is a monogamous, solitary hole-nester (Fry et al. 1988) with breeding occurring between August and February (Tarboton 1997b). A generation length of 4.2 years is provided by BirdLife International (2014dk). It is found in a variety of dense arboreal habitats, including coastal bush and Milkwood thickets, interior climax and Afromontane forest, dry thornveld, wooded valleys and gorges, Euphorbia thickets, and scrub-forest. It also occurs in tall Protea stands and stands of alien trees (Tarboton 1997b), and sporadically in gardens (Fry et al. 1988).</p>
	<h2>THREATS</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The species has not decreased markedly in EoO or AoO since the 2000 assessment. There is no documented evidence that the population is presently in decline, and there are no immediate threats known. However, given its naturally small range and population, and historic range contractions, the Knysna Woodpecker requires monitoring. It is vulnerable to habitat destruction and modification, and large-scale agriculture in combination with township development, has brought about habitat destruction and modification in areas of its former range, particularly KwaZulu-Natal (Barnes 2000x). A shortage of natural nest sites may exist in parts of the range (Tarboton 1997b), which makes it vulnerable to the felling of dead trees for firewood. The potential effects of climate change on this range-restricted species have not been fully investigated but should be assessed.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES UNDERWAY</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">No conservation measures focusing specifically on the Knysna Woodpecker are currently underway.</p>
	<h2>CONSERVATION MEASURES PROPOSED</h2>
	<p class="Body" lang="en-US">The area of suitable habitat with protected status should be increased. The species occasionally breeds in artificial nest boxes (Büttiker 1960) and agave stumps (Ginn et al. 1989), so providing artificial nesting sites may encourage breeding in areas where dead trees are scarce or have been felled.</p>
